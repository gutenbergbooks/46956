<h2>NED, THE SON OF WEBB.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 53px;">
<img src="images/image5.jpg" width="53" height="6" alt="line" />
</div>

<p class="ph2" style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChIc" name="ChI." id="ChI.">CHAPTER I.</a></p>

<p class="ph3">THE WAR SPIRIT.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">"S<span class="smcap">he's</span> grand!" exclaimed Ned, enthusiastically.
"Uncle Jack, the <i>Kentucky</i>
could knock any other ironclad in all the
world!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps she could," growled Uncle Jack,
somewhat thoughtfully. "I'm glad she is out
of range of them, just now, though. I like
her looks as she is. It is best for them, too."</p>

<p>They were standing near the head of Pier
Number One, North River, gazing at the great
line-of-battle ship as she steamed along slowly
up the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those double turrets make her as tall as
a house," said Ned. "There's nothing else
like her! See the long noses of those big
guns!"</p>

<p>"That's what I came for," replied Uncle
Jack. "I wanted to see her, and now I have
seen her I am more opposed to war than ever.
I'm going to join the Peace Society."</p>

<p>"I'd rather join the navy," said Ned.
"But if a shell from one of those guns should
burst inside of another ship it would blow her
sky-high."</p>

<p>"No!" responded his uncle, with firmness.
"She would not go up to the sky, she would
go down to the bottom of the deep sea."</p>

<p>"She could do it, anyhow," said Ned, not
explaining which of the two ships he referred
to.</p>

<p>It was evident that Uncle Jack was too
deeply interested in the <i>Kentucky</i> to care for
general conversation. For fear, however, that
he might not have read the papers, his somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
excited nephew told him that the steel-clad
wonder of the sea had at least twelve
thousand horses in her steam engines. He
also said that she was of twelve thousand tons
burden, but did not say whether that was the
load she could carry or whether it might be
supposed to be her fighting weight.</p>

<p>"I wish I were captain of her," he declared,
at last. "I'd like to conquer England."</p>

<p>"I felt just so once," responded Uncle Jack.
"There is more in England that is worth
capturing than there is anywhere else. You
would need more than one ship, though. I
tried the experiment, but the English beat
me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Ned. "I know how you
tried it. You went alone, though, and without
any <i>Kentucky</i>."</p>

<p>"No," said his uncle, "I didn't go alone.
Your aunt went with me. So did thousands
of other brave Americans. They try it every
year, and they always come home beaten."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Ned. "They spend all
their money, and are glad to get back. They
say the English can whip anything in all the
world except Americans. I'm going there,
some day. I don't believe there is any British
ship that can whip the <i>Kentucky</i>."</p>

<p>"She certainly is magnificent," replied his
uncle. "She is a tremendous war machine.
What we are ever to do with her, however,
I don't care to think of. I want her
never to fire one of those guns. After all,
Ned, if one of her great steel bottom plates
should get shaken loose and drop out, that
vast leviathan would sink, with all on
board."</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Ned. "They would get
away in the boats. Besides, she isn't going
to fall to pieces right away."</p>

<p>"All right," said his uncle. "We've seen
her. Now let's go home."</p>

<p>They turned away and walked on across
what the people of New York call the Battery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
They do so because here was a fort once.
Part of it, nearest the water, was made there
two centuries ago. Another part, more like
a modern fort, was made later, and it was
distinguished for having been surrendered,
back and forth, without firing one of its guns
in defence, more times than any other military
post in America. It was given up once
by the Dutch, twice by the British, and
once by the Americans. That was by General
Washington, when the English troops
drove him and his ragged rebels out of New
York. None of the fighting that was done
then was anywhere near the Battery.</p>

<p>Ned had something to say about that, as
they went along, and about the other forts
around the harbour, of which he seemed to be
very proud.</p>

<p>"My boy," remarked his uncle, "almost all
of our New York forts are back numbers.
One steel canoe like the <i>Kentucky</i>, if she
were English, for instance, and if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
conquering England, could knock all of those
old-fashioned affairs about our ears."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ned, doubtfully, "so the
<i>Kentucky</i> or the <i>Oregon</i> could do for any old
fort in Europe. I say, Uncle Jack, right here
is the lower end of all the elevated railways."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said his uncle; "and of the
cable-cars that are hauled by a steel rope
underground. Away up yonder is the suspension
bridge from this city to Brooklyn.
There will be a dozen of them, more or less,
before long. All over the upper part of town
the trolley-cars run by lightning on a string.
I hate all these modern inventions and innovations&mdash;I
do! I hate railways up in the air
on stilts, and I hate express trains that go a
mile a minute, and I hate these electric lights.
Why, Ned, when I was a boy, we were able to
get first-rate tallow-dip candles to read by.
Nobody can have anything of that kind, nowadays.
Now, just look at those forty-story-chimney
buildings! Fellows who live at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
top of those things have to be shot up. It's
awful!"</p>

<p>"I went up four of them," said Ned. "I
wanted to know how it felt."</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Jack, "how did you
feel?"</p>

<p>"I held my breath," replied Ned, "and I
held on to the seat. I was glad to get out,
though, top and bottom. I suppose a fellow
can get used to it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ned," interrupted his uncle, "wait here a
minute. I want to have a little talk with a
friend of mine in Chicago. What they won't
do next, with electricity and some things, I
don't know."</p>

<p>They were in front of a long-distance telephone
office, and Uncle Jack went in. His
conversation with his neighbour, a thousand
miles away, turned out a long one, and it was
half an hour before he and his nephew reached
the patch of cleared land which still remains
around the City Hall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" suddenly exclaimed Ned. "Hurrah!
We're having first-rate luck, Uncle
Jack! That's the very thing I've been
wanting to see!"</p>

<p>It was not another building, this time, and
it was not altogether an innovation. It was
something warlike and terrible; for a battery
of the Fourth Regular Artillery, guns, ammunition
wagons, all, was passing through
the city, down Broadway, on its journey to
some new post of duty.</p>

<p>"Those are three-inch calibre, long range
guns," said Uncle Jack. "They send shells
ten miles or so, to split things. The gun-barrels
are longer than a fence-rail. For my
part, I don't like 'em. They shoot too far."</p>

<p>"They're the right thing to have," said
Ned. "If I were going to conquer England
I'd want plenty of those guns."</p>

<p>"They'd be of no use at all to you, if you
had them," said Uncle Jack. "The London
police wouldn't let you keep 'em. They'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
take them right away from you, as soon as
you landed. You would be fined, too. It's
against English law for any fellow to carry
such things around with him."</p>

<p>Ned was silenced by that, for the time, and
they both got into a street-car, and went on
up-town. There were plenty of things worth
seeing, all along, but the car was so crowded
with passengers that they were packed, as
Uncle Jack complained, "like sardines in a
box." So they stood still, and hardly saw
anything.</p>

<p>When at last they stepped out, and walked
over toward one of the gateways of Central
Park, he growled again.</p>

<p>"There they go!" he exclaimed. "One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four
of 'em. They are those
automobile carriages, that go without any
horses. I like a horse, myself. That is, if
he's a good one, and pulls well in harness.
I was kicked half to death by one of my
horses, once. I think he had some kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
automobile in him. If you should ever happen
to conquer England, you'd get fine horses."</p>

<p>"That's what mother says," replied Ned.
"She's a good American now, but she was
born in England. She says they have the
best horses in the world."</p>

<p>"Not by any means equal to ours," snapped
Uncle Jack. "Ours are so fine that we are
going to preserve some of them for specimens,
after we get so that all our riding and pulling
is done by steam and electricity. We shall
keep pictures of them, too, and statues, so
that people who live in such times as are to
come may know what sort of animals horses
used to be."</p>

<p>Uncle Jack appeared to be in a bad state of
mind, that day, for he went on to denounce
vigorously a long list of things. He even
went so far as to condemn the entire Anglo-Saxon
race, English and American together.</p>

<p>"Look at it, Ned!" he said, with energy.
"Not only do both of these wretched nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
come down to this new state of things, themselves,
including the newspapers and the
magazines and the floods of books, but they are
clubbing together to force innovations upon
all the rest of the world. They are a partnership
concern now, and which of them is the
meanest I don't know. The British are
choking their inventions down the throats of
China, India, Africa, and a lot of other
unlucky continents and islands. We Americans
are working in the same way with Cuba
and Porto Rico and the Philippines and
Magatapatanglew."</p>

<p>"Where on earth is that?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" sadly responded his uncle,
shaking his head. "I really don't know.
Nobody else knows where half of these new
places are, with long-tail names. I've a kind
of notion it's near the junction."</p>

<p>"What junction?" inquired his nephew.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Uncle Jack. "The
junction? You don't know? It is at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
corner where the Congo River crosses
the Ganges. It is very near the point where
the Ural Mountains pour down into the Red
Sea."</p>

<p>Ned was not entirely caught and mystified,
this time, for he promptly replied: "Oh, I
know where that is! I've been to Grammar
School Sixty-eight. I know! It's down near
the custom house."</p>

<p>"I declare!" said his uncle. "Boys know
too much, anyhow, nowadays. You would
learn a great deal more, though, if you'd take
an army and a steamer, and go and conquer
England. Your mother has dozens of cousins
there, too. But you had better buy return
excursion tickets before you start. That's
what I did, and it helped me to get back
home. Let's go to dinner."</p>

<p>"It's about dinner-time," said Ned; and
his uncle talked along as they went.</p>

<p>"I like the English for one thing," he said.
"They cook good dinners. I hate 'em for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
another thing, though: if you go to an English
dinner-party, you have to wait till the last
man gets there before they will give you anything
to eat. I conquered them a little on
that, anyhow, for I always went two hours
late, myself. So I generally had to wait only
about half an hour or so."</p>

<p>Ned studied that matter until he thought
he understood it. Afterward, however, he
was glad to be an American, when his own
dinner came to the table exactly on time. So
did he and his uncle.</p>

<p>A long walk, and sightseeing, combined
with plans for the conquest of England, will
surely prepare a healthy sixteen-year-old boy
for his dinner, especially if he is somewhat
tall for his age and burly in build. Ned was
not quite prepared, nevertheless, for some
things which were coming upon him. He
could not have expected, reasonably, that his
entire family would set him up for a mark
and shoot at him. That is what they did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and they fired at him from all around the
table, hitting him.</p>

<p>"Ned," began Uncle Jack, "I heard you!
Where on earth did you learn to speak Norwegian?
Not at the grammar school."</p>

<p>"Why," said Ned, "I got it from old Erica.
She has been in the house since before I was
born. She began with me when I was doing
my first words of any kind."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Uncle Jack, "that's it! I
suppose even the Norway babies catch it that
way."</p>

<p>"I see," said his father. "It is about the
same way with your Latin. I used to talk
Latin at you when you wore frocks. You are
pretty well up in it, for a boy only just graduated
from a public school. Perhaps it may
be of use to you, some day; but I am afraid
that your Norwegian never will."</p>

<p>"Not unless he should go there, if he ever
travels," said his mother. "What he needs
to do now is to get out into the country. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
has been cooped up in the city and held down
over his books long enough."</p>

<p>"He must spend a few weeks at his grandfather's
house," remarked his Aunt Maria,
with a severe expression. "He must go
fishing. His health requires it."</p>

<p>So said his sisters and his older brothers,
and then Uncle Jack gave him away entirely,
telling of Ned's dealings with the <i>Kentucky</i>,
and with the other wonders they had seen
that morning.</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" exclaimed his father.
"He wishes to conquer England! I know
some English boys that could make him wish
he were hiding on board the <i>Kentucky</i>."</p>

<p>"Well," responded Ned, rebelliously, "I'm
not so sure about that! I'm captain of the
baseball nine. I'm in on football, too. I
can fence first-rate, and I've had Pat McCool
for a boxing master."</p>

<p>"Oh!" remarked Aunt Maria. "Now I
know! That is why you came home limping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
so horridly, a week ago Saturday. You had
a pair of black eyes, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's nothing, Aunt Maria," interrupted
Ned. "That was Jimmy Finley. We were
boxing barehanded. He got it as bad as I
did, too."</p>

<p>"Edward," exclaimed his mother, "that is
shocking! It is like fighting! And you have
been talking slang, too!"</p>

<p>"Well, mother," said Ned, respectfully, "I
didn't mean to; but Jim is a regular rusher
to hit."</p>

<p>"Edward!" said his father. "Slang again?
I must take you in hand, myself."</p>

<p>"He is dreadful!" whispered one of his
sisters. "He called Sallie Hemans a bricktop.
Her hair is red&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see how it is," continued his father.
"The sooner you are out in the country, the
better. Football, indeed! Baseball, fencing,
boxing! All that sort of thing! What you
need is exercise. Fishing, I should say, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
plenty of good, fresh country air. Something
beside books and school."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, then," responded Ned.
"I'll be glad enough to get there. All the
colts I rode last summer'll be a year older
now. I'm going to try 'em, and see if they
can send me to grass, like they did then."</p>

<p>"Edward! What grammar!" groaned his
aunt. "His Grandmother Webb will attend
to that."</p>

<p>"I have my serious doubts," remarked
Uncle Jack. "She has not altogether reformed
her own neighbourhood. The country
is the place for him, however. If he isn't
sent away he may stir up a war with England,
and it would be expensive."</p>

<p>From that the table talk drifted back to the
terrible battle-ships and the new inventions.</p>

<p>"It is dreadful!" remarked Uncle Jack.
"I used to think I knew, generally, what I
was eating, but I have given it up. They
have invented artificial eggs. The butter we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
get is a mystery; they make almost anything
out of corn. The newspapers are printed on
stuff that's made of cord-wood, and this new
imitation silver is nothing but potter's clay,
boiled down, somehow. It tires me out to
think of it all."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Ned. "Hurrah for
the country, and for the colts, and for some
fishing!"</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChIIc" name="ChII." id="ChII.">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">NED WEBB'S OUTING.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">"Y<span class="smcap">our</span> grandmother is right, Edward. I
agree with her entirely. She thinks
that too much of your vacation time ought
not to be spent in the woods, and it must not
be. I wish, however, to say something more.
Your education must continue without too
great an interruption. There are ideas which
I intend you to obtain while under my care."</p>

<p>"Why, grandfather!" exclaimed Ned, with
a somewhat puzzled look on his face. "I
think so, too. I don't care to be all the while
in the woods. I want to do some fishing."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said his grandfather. "We both
approve of that. You may have all the rods
and lines you need, but you must not forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the wise saying of the immortal Franklin,
that going fishing means only a rod and line
with a worm at each end of it. There is not
much to be caught in Green Lake."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ned, "I guess I'll pull in
something better'n suckers and bullheads.
There are trout and perch and bass and
pickerel."</p>

<p>"Eels, too," suggested his grandfather.
"What I mean is, practically, that you are to
employ a part of each day among your books.
I especially wish you to acquire a rudimentary
acquaintance with the history of the world
you live in."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know what that is," said
Ned. "They bored us with it, awfully, at
School Number Sixty-eight. I had to be
examined on it, too, and I didn't get turned
down."</p>

<p>Ned had safely reached his grandfather's
house in the country. It was a large and
handsome mansion. They two were now in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the library, on the morning after his arrival.
One glance at the ranges of bookcases was
enough to afford an indication of the old
gentleman's hobby. He was a distinguished
member of the Historical Society; of the
Antediluvian Research Association; of the
Paleontological; the Paleozoic, and of several
other brilliant scientific corporations. He was
a short, stocky old man, and very positive in
his manners. Possibly he might now have
responded even severely, but at this moment
a tall, thin, gray-haired, benevolent-looking
woman entered the library.</p>

<p>"Edward," she said, brushing a lot of dust
from her dress, "I've been going over that
fishing-tackle for you. You may pick out all
you want of it, if you'll only let the guns
alone. I can't let you play with gunpowder.
Your grandfather mustn't make a bookworm
of you, either."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Ned, "I was thinking of
that. Worms! I guess I know where to dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
'em. What I'm going to go for, this morning,
is the horses."</p>

<p>"That's what you may do," said his grandfather,
somewhat as if he had been getting
orders from his wife. "You'd better fight
shy of that sorrel filly, though. She might
pitch you over her head."</p>

<p>"Why, Edward," interposed his grandmother,
"you rode that colt a good many
times, last vacation. She's better broken
in now. I've driven her, myself. She's as
kind and gentle as a kitten, but she's
playful."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked the old gentleman.
"She kicked one buggy into the middle of
next week. I won't drive her."</p>

<p>There was more to be said, but Ned escaped
with his grandmother to go and take a look
at the fishing-tackle. It was in a closet of
one of the up-stairs rooms, and it was worth
any boy's while to have the rummaging of
that closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a perfect curiosity shop," said Ned,
as he stared into it. "Why, grandmother, he
must have been a tremendous fisherman."</p>

<p>"So he was," she said, "when he was a
younger man. That isn't all of it, though.
This is his collection of all the implements
employed by civilised and uncivilised tribes
for catching fish. It isn't sorted very well,
but that other side is packed with nets and
spears. I'm afraid there isn't a really good
boat for you on Green Lake. Clumsy things!"</p>

<p>"Anything'll do for me," said Ned. "I'm a
sailor. Do you know, the other day, I went
to see the <i>Kentucky</i>, the new line-o'-battle-ship.
She's a giant."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" laughed the old lady. "If
your grandfather could buy her at auction,
he'd stow her away in this closet, for one of
his specimens."</p>

<p>"I can see all I want," replied Ned. "I'll
come and pick it out by and by. May I
go to the barns now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go right along," she said. "Hadn't you
better take a ride to Green Lake? It's only
a mile or so, and horseback exercise'll do you
good."</p>

<p>She kept him a few minutes, however, to
explain the nature of some of the more remarkable
antiquities in the closet. Then he
was down-stairs again, but he was not a free
boy yet, for his grandfather caught him and
led him into the library again.</p>

<p>"Edward," he said, solemnly, as they
passed the doorway, "if there is anything
I disapprove of, more than another, it is
what they are printing nowadays to occupy
the empty minds of the young,&mdash;the things
which they advertise as popular books for
boys, for instance. I find that even where
they are more or less historical in character,
they are also perniciously imaginative, often
presenting utter improbabilities as history. I
will show you something, now, that will be
worth your while. I suppose that you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
not know anything of consequence concerning
your Scandinavian forefathers."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Ned. "Our old Erica's
a Norway girl. I can talk with her in
Norwegian."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed his grandfather.
"Have you actually acquired the difficult
tongue of the Vikings and Berserkers?
That is wonderful! Then you will be
doubly interested in the work you are
about to peruse."</p>

<p>"I guess I can swallow it," said Ned.
"Are you going to give me a look at it?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman walked over to a corner
of the library and pulled out from one of
the lower shelves an exceedingly promising
or portentous volume. He was a strong
man, and he lifted it to the centre-table,
throwing it wide open as he did so, and
remarking:</p>

<p>"There, now! That's a book for a boy!"</p>

<p>Ned drew a long breath, in spite of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dust that flew from the book, as he came to
the table.</p>

<p>"Examine it," said his grandfather.</p>

<p>Ned turned first to the title-page, of course,
to see what it was.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are works of art, all of 'em," said
his grandfather. "I believe them to be sufficiently
accurate, and that you may depend
upon their instructive value."</p>

<p>"I see," said Ned. "All about ever so
many fights. I'll go right into it. Tell you
what, grandfather, there isn't any school-book
about this."</p>

<p>The old gentleman was evidently gratified
by the eagerness with which Ned began to
turn over the leaves, and he remarked,
benevolently:</p>

<p>"It will give you a thorough knowledge of
men and times whereof we have as yet discovered
very little. The Vikings were a wonderful
race of men."</p>

<p>"They'd fight like anything," said Ned.
"Pirates, buccaneers, freebooters,&mdash;I'd like
to see one of their battles. They blew horns
all the while. Yelled. Sung songs. Yes,
sir! It's the biggest kind of book."</p>

<p>"Go, now," said his grandfather, still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
delighted with Ned's enthusiasm. "You
may try the sorrel colt, but be careful."</p>

<p>The barns and stables of the Webb place
were at some distance in the rear of the
mansion. At the right of the largest barn
was a four-acre paddock, but it did not seem
to have many occupants. At this hour of
the day all work-horses were away at their
farm duties. The carriage-horses were in
their stalls, waiting for orders. All that
Ned saw, therefore, on his arrival, were a
brace of very young colts, four Devon calves,
as handsome as pictures, and one three-year-old
sorrel filly. She was in the hands of a
groom, and instead of a halter she was wearing
a bridle, with a plain snaffle-bit. Just
at this moment the groom was putting upon
her back a pretty blue blanket with white
borders. She was a large animal for her
age, and Ned was already aware that she
had earned a reputation as a racer.</p>

<p>"There's speed in her!" he remarked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
"She'll show time, one of these days.
Temper? Well, I don't care if there is.
Good horses always have some."</p>

<p>Nanny's beautiful eyes looked gentle
enough, and they were full of intelligence.
She neighed inquiringly as he drew nearer.</p>

<p>"Hullo! How are ye, Masther Ned?
Hark to the mare, now. She's askin' the
name of ye. Come along, and spake to
her."</p>

<p>"How are you, Pat McCarty?" called
back Ned. "Nanny's looking fine! Grandfather
says I may ride her."</p>

<p>"All right," said Pat. "She's ready. I
was goin' to exercise her, meself."</p>

<p>A dozen more questions and answers followed
rapidly, while Ned was caressing and
admiring the perfectly shaped quadruped.
She turned her pretty head to look at him,
as he walked around her, and he was aware
of a curious notion that she was now and
then winking at him. She seemed, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
same time, a little impatient and restless, as
if it irritated her to have to stand still.</p>

<p>"You'll do as well without a saddle," said
Pat. "Sometimes she objects to a saddle.
The blanket and surcingle is all the summer
goods she wants to wear."</p>

<p>"Guess they're enough," laughed Ned.</p>

<p>He was getting wildly eager for his romp
with Nanny. Whether or not she remembered
him, she seemed to be disposed to treat
him politely. She even craned out her neck
and pulled off his hat for him, taking the brim
in her teeth.</p>

<p>"She's friendly, the day," said Pat. "Put
your fut in me hand and I'll give ye the lift
to the back of her."</p>

<p>Ned was as nimble as a monkey. In a
moment more he was on Nanny's back, bridle
in hand, feeling splendidly.</p>

<p>"Aff wid ye," said Pat. "I'll open the
gate for ye. Ave she wants to go, though,
it's little good to thry an' hould her in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't," said Ned. "I'll just let her
fly!"</p>

<p>He was thrilling all over with the excitement
of being so well mounted, and he really
knew how to ride. As for Nanny, she appeared
to be set on springs, and her progress
to the gate was a series of graceful curvetings,
as easy for her rider as the motion of
a rocking-chair.</p>

<p>They were now in the barnyard, and a
lane from this led out into the road. Pat
was no longer needed, for the yard gate was
open, and Nanny pranced along through without
any guiding.</p>

<p>"Luk at her!" shouted Pat. "She's out
for fun the day. She's full o' life. Oh! but
isn't she a beauty!"</p>

<p>"Whoop!" yelled Ned. "This is better
than being shut up in a grammar school."</p>

<p>"It's the fine b'ye he is, ave they don't
spile him entirely, among thim," remarked
Pat, thoughtfully. "The ould grandmother'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
give him the house and all, and the grandfather's
been just a-waitin' for him till he
kem. They're the right sort o' people, thim
Webbs."</p>

<p>The highway was clear and Nanny went
into it at her own gait, a kind of springing,
elastic canter that was not at first very rapid.</p>

<p>"This is the road toward Green Lake,"
thought Ned. "It's just the one I meant to
take. I'll get there, to-morrow or next day,
and see if there's any fishing. Sometimes
they didn't bite worth a cent, last year. I'll
find a boat, somehow. I can take a book
along, too. Then I won't have to sit still for
an hour at a time, doing nothing."</p>

<p>Men and women in wagons and carriages,
which he shortly met or passed, all turned
for a look at Nanny, and it was quite apparent
that she appreciated their admiration.
Two or three times, indeed, she induced Ned
to make a mild, restraining pull upon the
bridle, but each time she resented his attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
at control by a shake of her head, followed
by a vigorous bound forward.</p>

<p>"I'd better take Pat's advice," he thought.
"If she wants to speed it, I'll let her go.
I can stick on, anyhow."</p>

<p>He had no doubt whatever on that point,
and was not at all nervous. At the end of
less than three-quarters of a mile, however,
there was a narrow lane that left the highway
on the right, though not at right angles.
This lane was bordered by rail fences, trees,
bushes, and farther on it led through a patch
of dense forest.</p>

<p>"Green Lake Lane," thought Ned. "I
won't go there to-day."</p>

<p>On that point he should have first consulted
the sorrel colt under him. The instant
she came to the head of the lane she uttered
a sharp exclamation and whirled gaily into
it. Ned at once drew upon his bridle in an
attempt to guide her back into the highway.
Up went her heels a little viciously, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her easy gallop changed into something like
a run. If she had now only a quarter-mile
to go, she was determined to make short
work of whatever errand was in her mind.</p>

<p>"She's going like lightning!" exclaimed
Ned, clinging his best and pulling hard.</p>

<p>"This lane runs right on into the lake.
Oh, my!"</p>

<p>Faster, faster, went the beautiful thoroughbred
racer. The trees at the roadside seemed
to go flashing by, and now the lake itself was
in full view ahead.</p>

<p>It was a broad, placid, forest-bordered sheet
of water, apparently somewhat irregular in
shape. There were neither wharves nor
piers nor boathouses to be seen.</p>

<p>The entire lake landscape was wildly picturesque,&mdash;if
Ned could at that moment have
considered at all any of the beauties of nature.
He could not have done so, for it seemed to
him that Nanny was not even giving him
time to think. Long afterward, he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
asking himself if it were possible that
Nanny had any idea of going for a swim.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a href="#nedc" id="ned">
<img class="border" src="images/image7.jpg" width="375" height="518" alt="&quot;NED DID NOT SIT STILL AT ALL.&quot;" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">"NED DID NOT SIT STILL AT ALL."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>She had no such intentions, indeed. She
had other plans and purposes, and she carried
out her own conception of a grand
morning romp with Ned to perfection.</p>

<p>The moderate slope to the water's edge
was green with grass, and the little waves
came rippling in smilingly. The water there
was not very shallow, however.</p>

<p>On&mdash;on&mdash;sprang swiftly the sorrel colt,
and it was plain that only the lake itself
could stop her.</p>

<p>That is, the bridle and bit were of no
account, but she could stop herself. Her
round yellow fore hoofs came down side by
side at the margin, and the water was only
a few inches above her silken fetlocks when
she suddenly, sharply braced herself as still
as if she had been instantaneously cast in
bronze for exhibition.</p>

<p>Ned did not sit still at all. He was cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
clean over the gracefully bowing head of
the playful Nanny, right into Green Lake,
as far as she could throw him.</p>

<p>Beyond all doubt, she had accomplished
her purposes remarkably well.</p>

<p>There was no actual harm done to her rider,
either, for the water in which Ned landed, if
a boy can correctly be said to land in water,
was fully four feet deep. He went into it
head first, heels up, hat flying, with a kind
of astonished yell in his throat that was
drowned before it could get away from him.</p>

<p>When he came to the surface again and
struck out for the shore, recapturing his
floating hat on the way, there stood Nanny
entirely calm and as gentle as ever.</p>

<p>Now again he could almost have believed
that she was winking at him. She neighed
very kindly, drank some lake water, and then
she lifted her head and gazed around the lake
as if she enjoyed the scenery.</p>

<p>"I can mount her again," asserted Ned, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he stood still to drip. "Oh, but ain't I glad
I lighted on something soft! It wasn't a fair
throw, anyhow. I hadn't anything left to
hold on with."</p>

<p>Whatever he meant by that, she had slung
him over her head, and there was very little
doubt but what she could do it again. She
had a will of her own, too, as to being ridden,
and she as much as said so when he went to
get hold of her bridle, intending to lead her
to a neighbouring log and remount. He did
not succeed in putting a hand on the leather.
Up went her heels, around she whirled, and
away she went, neighing cheerfully as she
galloped along the lane.</p>

<p>"Now, this is too bad!" groaned Ned.
"I'm as wet as a drowned rat and I've got
to foot it home. Nanny'll get there before
I do, too, unless she runs away somewhere
else, and they'll all wonder what's become of
me."</p>

<p>He felt humiliated, discouraged, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
at all like the kind of fellow to command
ironclads and lead armies.</p>

<p>There was nothing else to be done, nevertheless,
and he began to trudge dolefully
along on his homeward way. Walking in
wet clothing is not very comfortable exercise,
anyhow, and Ned was not now, by
any means, the nobby-looking young man
from the city that he had been when he
rode away that morning. Even more than
before, when he was so well mounted, did
curious people turn in their carriages and
wagons to stare at him. It was on his mind
that every one of them had a good laugh and
remarked:</p>

<p>"That chap's had a ducking!"</p>

<p>He plodded along, and succeeded in getting
half-way before anything serious occurred.
Then, indeed, he suddenly stood stock-still,
and wished he had been farther.</p>

<p>"There they come!" he exclaimed. "There
are grandfather and grandmother and Pat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and old Mrs. Emmons and Uncle Jack. More
people behind 'em. Oh, dear! They've seen
me already, or I'd climb a fence."</p>

<p>It was altogether too late for any attempt
at escape. In a few moments more they were
in front of him, and all around him, saying
all sorts of things so rapidly that he had to
keep shut up till they gave him a chance.</p>

<p>"Oh, my blessed boy!" exclaimed Grandmother
Webb. "If you wasn't so wet, I'd
hug you! We thought the colt had thrown
you; we were afraid you were killed!"</p>

<p>"No!" said Ned, with energy. "But she
fired me over her head into the lake, and I
swam ashore."</p>

<p>"I caught her," put in Pat McCarty.
"Here she is,&mdash;the beauty! That was for
thryin' to hould her in. You must niver do
that ag'in."</p>

<p>"I didn't pull much," said Ned.</p>

<p>Uncle Jack had been looking him all over,
critically, from head to foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"That lake is very wet," he remarked.
"Ned, my boy, I'm glad the critter projected
you into soft water. You've come out of it a
fine-looking bird."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Ned. "This blue flannel
doesn't shrink with wetting. My hat'll be
all right as soon as it's dry; so'll my shoes."</p>

<p>At that moment he heard a shrill, soft
neigh close to his ear, and Nanny poked her
head over his shoulder to gaze affectionately
at the family gathering, as if she felt that
she was entitled to some of the credit of the
occasion.</p>

<p>"It's the fun of her," said Pat. "It's just
the joke she played on the b'ye. She knows
more'n half the min."</p>

<p>"Edward," commanded his grandfather,
"come right back to the house."</p>

<p>"He can't ketch cold sech a day as this,"
said old Mrs. Emmons, "or I'd make him some
pepper tea; but his mother mustn't hear of it.
How it would skeer her!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, it wouldn't," said Ned. "She knows
I can swim. Father won't care, either, so
long's I got ashore."</p>

<p>The procession set out for the house, Pat
and Nanny marching ahead. It grew, too, as
it went, for ever so many of the village boys
came hurrying to join it, and to inquire how
it was that Nanny made out to throw Ned
into Green Lake. Then they all went forward
to walk along with her, full of admiration for
a colt that knew how to give a boy a ducking.</p>

<p>"She slung him," said one.</p>

<p>"Hove him clean over her head."</p>

<p>"She was goin' a mile a minute."</p>

<p>"If I'd ha' been Ned, I'd ha' braced back
and stuck on."</p>

<p>"Then she'd ha' rolled over."</p>

<p>Not one of them offered to ride her, however;
and the procession reached the house.
When it did so, Nanny broke away from Pat,
and cantered on to the barn-yard. The gate
from that into the paddock was shut, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
went over it with a splendid leap, to begin a
kind of dance around the Devon calves.</p>

<p>"It's mighty little good to fence in the like
of her," remarked Pat. "I'm thinkin' I'd
better give the b'ye wan o' thim other cowlts."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChIIIc" name="ChIII." id="ChIII.">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">A VERY WIDE LAKE.</p>


<p class="drop-cap">"T<span class="smcap">his</span> is the coolest place there is in the
house," remarked Ned, as he looked
around the library that hot June afternoon.
"Grandmother and the rest of them have
gone out to the Sewing Society. What a fuss
they made! As if a bit of a swim could hurt
me!"</p>

<p>The shelves and cases were crowded with
books, and at first he did nothing but lie
in a big wickerwork chair, and stare at
them.</p>

<p>"No," he said, aloud, "I won't do any
reading, not in such a sweltering day as
this is. I can get out that Norway book,
though, and look at the pictures."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He pulled it out, and lugged it to the table,
with a strong impression upon his mind that
it was a book to be carried around in January
rather than in June.</p>

<p>"It never will be a popular book for boys,"
he remarked of it. "Not for small boys."</p>

<p>Open it came, and he began with a study
of the abundant illustrations. They were
fine, and they stirred him up, by degrees,
until he began to feel a growing interest in
the reading matter scattered along among
them. It was all in large type, so that the
pages might be conquered easily, one after
another. Before long he found himself entirely
absorbed in the narrative of the old
Norse times.</p>

<p>"Curious lot of men they were," he remarked,
"those Vikings. How they did
seem to enjoy killing their enemies and cutting
each other's heads off! They'd steal
anything, too. Tell you what, though, if
I'd been wearing one o' their coats of mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
when Nanny pitched me into the lake, I'd
ha' gone to the bottom like a stone. I
wonder if any of 'em could swim in their
armour? I don't believe they could. Most
likely they took it off if they were going to
be wrecked anywhere. A fellow in a steel
shirt ought to have some life-preservers
handy."</p>

<p>More and more intense became his interest
as he went on, and at about tea-time his
grandfather came in.</p>

<p>"What, Ned?" asked the old gentleman.
"Are you at it yet? That's all right, but I
can't let you do too much of it. You must
spend all the time you can in the open air.
You may read this evening, but to-morrow
morning you must go fishing. You may
take a book with you."</p>

<p>"I'll take along this one, then," said Ned.
"I can read between bites."</p>

<p>"That's what I do sometimes," said his
grandfather. "I think it averages about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
books to each fish, but a pike pulled a dictionary
overboard for me, once."</p>

<p>"What did he want of a dictionary?"
asked Ned. "Did you hook him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I pulled him in," said the old gentleman,
"but the book went out of sight. It's
going to be too warm for trolling for pike."</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Ned. "I'm going to
find some grasshoppers."</p>

<p>"They're the right bait," said Grandfather
Webb. "Better than worms. The lake is
full of bullheads. So is the wide, wide
world. I've been out there, just now, talking
to one of 'em. He's an Englishman.
He's been beating me out of ten dollars, and
he won't understand my explanation of it.
He insists on keeping the ten."</p>

<p>"That's like 'em," said Ned. "I'd like to
conquer England. Uncle Jack says that if I
did they'd lock me up in the station-house."</p>

<p>"That's what they'd do," said his grandfather.
"Anybody that invaded England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
would be arrested at once. They'd convict
him, too, and make him buy something of
'em."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Ned, "I'm going there,
some day. It's about the greatest country in
the world. I'm going to see London, and the
forts, and the ships. The English soldiers
and sailors can fight like anything. They
can whip anybody but Americans."</p>

<p>"Come to supper!" commanded his grandfather;
"then you may go on with your
book. I'm afraid, though, that if you were
in command of the <i>Kentucky</i> you'd try to
steam her all over England, across lots, without
minding the fences."</p>

<p>At the supper-table Ned was compelled to
hear quite a number of remarks about swimming
in Green Lake.</p>

<p>"He'd better try that colt in a buggy, next
time," said Mrs. Emmons. "She's skittish."</p>

<p>"She likes a buggy," remarked Uncle
Jack. "Pat lent her to one of his best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
friends, last week, to drive her a mile or so
for exercise. She didn't stop short of Centreville
Four Corners. The buggy's there,
now, in the wagon-shop getting mended,
and Nanny came home alone, quiet as a
lamb."</p>

<p>"I guess Edward may drive one of the
other horses," said his grandmother. "Pat'll
pick out a quiet one."</p>

<p>"I'd want a buggy, or something," said
Ned, "if I was to take that big book of
grandfather's with me. I never saw such
pictures, though. Loads of 'em."</p>

<p>"Read it! Read it!" said his grandfather.
"When you get through with it, you'll know
more'n you do now."</p>

<p>They let him alone after that, and talked
of other affairs. He was quite willing to
keep still, and he got away from the table
before anybody else. There was a growing
fever upon him to dive into that folio and to
find out how the story fitted the pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
No one happened to go into the library until
about eleven o'clock, and he was there alone.
Then old Mrs. Emmons herself was hunting
everywhere for a ball of yarn she had lost,
and she tried the library. Ned was not reading
when she came in. He was lying
stretched half-way across the table, sound
asleep, with his head on the open book, and
the cat curled up beside it.</p>

<p>"I had to shake him awake," she reported
afterward, "and the cat followed him when
he went up-stairs to his room."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was awake again not long
after sunrise, next morning, and hurried out
on a bait hunt. Before breakfast he had
done well as to angleworms, but not so well
as to grasshoppers. Of these he had captured
only six, shutting them up in a little
tin match-box.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said his grandfather, when
they came out of the house together, after
breakfast, "here's your rod. Three good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lines. Plenty of hooks and sinkers. The
boat's down there at the landing."</p>

<p>"I saw it when I swam ashore," said
Ned. "It's a scow-punt and it isn't much
bigger'n a wash-tub."</p>

<p>"It's better than it looks," replied the old
gentleman. "I saw four men in it once, and
they went half-way across the lake before it
upset with them."</p>

<p>"Did any of 'em get drowned?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Webb, "not more'n half
drowned. I was out in another boat with
Pat McCarty, trolling, and we fished in all
four of 'em. You needn't get upset unless
you try to carry Nanny or some of the boys.
I'd rather you'd not have any company.
Safer!"</p>

<p>"I don't want any of 'em along," said
Ned. "I'd rather be alone. Then I can
read while I'm waiting for fish. You said I
could take that big book."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, you may," said his grandfather.
"Put it into your bait-box. Be sure
you bring it home with you."</p>

<p>Away went Ned, and his grandfather
turned back into the house, laughing.</p>

<p>"He'll think twice," he said, "before he
lugs that folio to Green Lake, this hot day.
He won't take it."</p>

<p>He was only half right, for Ned had
already thought twice, at least, and had
decided what to do.</p>

<p>He had found a small, lightly made garden
hand-cart, two-wheeled, and when he set out
for Green Lake all his baggage was in the
cart, including the book, the angleworms, and
the grasshoppers. He succeeded in getting
away quietly, too, without giving Pat or
anybody else a chance to ask him if he
expected to need a wagon to bring home
his fish.</p>

<p>It was getting very warm before he was
half a mile from the house, for June days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
always grow warmer, rapidly, if you are
shoving a hand-cart.</p>

<p>"It was a good lift to get the book in,"
thought Ned. "I wish I'd greased the
wheels."</p>

<p>The boat lay idly at the shore when he
reached the landing-place. A pair of oars
lay in it, but he saw also something which
pleased him much more.</p>

<p>"Mast and sail!" he shouted. "Who'd
ha' thought of that! Hurrah!"</p>

<p>There they lay, a short mast, truly, and
a mere rag of sail, with a boom and sprit all
ready for use.</p>

<p>"I know how," thought Ned. "I can step
the mast and hoist the sail, myself. Then
I can tack all over the lake, without any
hard work a-rowing."</p>

<p>His first undertaking, however, was to get
his huge folio volume into the boat and not
into the water. He succeeded perfectly, with
some effort. Then he stepped his bit of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
mainmast, as he called it, through the hole
bored for it in the forward seat of the punt.
It was plain that he knew something about
naval affairs, for he spoke of his snub-nosed
cruiser as a "catboat," and regretted that she
had no "tiller."</p>

<p class="center">"JUNE DAYS ALWAYS GROW WARMER, RAPIDLY, IF

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"She hasn't any anchor, either," he said,
"except a rope and a crooked stone. She
has a keel, though, and there are thole-pins
in her bulwarks, starboard and port. She's
higher at the stern than she is at the prow,
and I'm afraid she'd be a little cranky in
a ten-knot breeze. She isn't ballasted to
speak of, and I'd better keep her well before
the wind. That's a little nor'west by north,
just now."</p>

<p>However that might be, he pushed his gallant
bark out from the shore, sitting in the
stern, and shoving the land away with the
rudder,&mdash;that is to say, with one of the oars.</p>

<p>The sail was already up, but it was a
question to be answered how he could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
told the direction from which the wind
was coming or where it was going. To any
ordinary observer, not an old salt nor the
commander of a line-of-battle ironclad, it
looked as if the wind had not yet reached
Green Lake. It had very likely paused
somewhere, in the village or over among
the woods.</p>

<p>"I'll have to row at first," he remarked.
"I think I can see a ripple out yonder.
Where there's a ripple, there's wind, or it
may have been made by that pickerel when
he jumped out after something. If he'll bite,
I'll pull him in."</p>

<p>Rowing is, after all, easy enough work when
there is no hurry and the boat is nearly empty.
Ned pulled gently on his oars, and the boom
and sail swung to and fro as she slipped along.
Pretty soon she reached and went through the
ripple made by the pickerel, leaving behind
her others that were larger, but which did not
indicate wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd give something for a catspaw," he
said, remembering another nautical term.
"I needn't furl the mainsail. She can drift
to looard, if she wants to, while I try for
some fish. If it's true that this lake hasn't
any bottom, it won't pay to cast anchor.
There isn't cable enough in that coil to do
any good."</p>

<p>He ceased rowing. He put his joint rod
together, and fitted on his reel, ready for
sport. The bait question was decided against
worms and in favour of grasshoppers, with
regret that he had so few.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "I don't much care
whether it's to be a bass or a pickerel."</p>

<p>No choice was given him, for in only a
minute or so more a handsome yellow perch
came over the side of the boat to account for
one grasshopper.</p>

<p>"That fellow'll weigh a pound, more or
less," he said. "I don't want any pumpkinseeds,
though."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>That, however, was the kind of fish he
pulled in next. Shortly afterward he had
the usual unpleasantness belonging to the
unhooking of a large, fat, slippery-skinned
bullhead. He was really making a very good
beginning indeed, considering what was the
established reputation of Green Lake.</p>

<p>"Uncle Jack said it was fished out," he
said to himself. "I guess there are more
shiners and pumpkinseeds than anything else.
Hullo! Here comes a big one!"</p>

<p>What seemed to be a tremendous tug at his
hook held on vigorously as he hauled in his
line. The excitement of that strong bite
made him tingle all over.</p>

<p>"Pickerel!" he shouted. "Or a big bass,
or maybe it's a pike or a lake trout. What
will Uncle Jack say, now?"</p>

<p>In a few moments more he was sadly
replying, on behalf of his uncle, "Nothing
but a cod-lamper eel!"</p>

<p>Soaked bush branches and pond weed are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
hard to pull in, and they are good for nothing
in a frying-pan. A fisherman's gloomiest
disappointments come to him in the landing
of them.</p>

<p>Another grasshopper was put on, and
another cast was made. The bullhead flopped
discontentedly on the bottom of the boat. So
did the perch, now and then, but there were
no other signs of fish life during the next
half-hour, with the sun all the while growing
hotter.</p>

<p>"I'll stick my rod," thought Ned, "and
throw out another line, with a worm. Then
I'll read till I get a bite. I think it's
coming on to blow a little. I can see signs
of weather."</p>

<p>So he could, really. Hardly were his two
hooks and lines in the water before what
some people romantically term a zephyr came
gently breathing along the placid lake. It
soon grew even strong enough to make itself
felt by the drooping sail, but Ned remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
as he lifted his eyes from his book illustrations:</p>

<p>"That canvas doesn't bend worth a cent.
I needn't take in any reef just now. Let her
spin along. Hullo! The boat's beginning to
move!"</p>

<p>He felt more and more sure of that while
he again bent over the folio, opened out upon
the middle seat, with an old starch box behind
it for his accommodation. The breeze had
come, what there was of it, but he shortly
forgot all about winds and fishing, while he
turned page after page of that book, and
took in more and more of the meaning of
the pictures. The sail was now filled well.
There were larger and larger wavelets on
the lake, but there came no fish-bites to interrupt
Ned's reading. He had no idea for
how long a time he had been sailing on,
without noticing anything whatever around
him. At last, however, the wind grew
strong enough to turn one of his book-leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for him, and he once more raised his
head.</p>

<p>"I declare!" he exclaimed. "This bit of
a gale is freshening. I'll haul on the main
sheet, and bring her head to the wind. She's
leaning over a little too much. If a gust or
a squall should come on, she might turn
turtle."</p>

<p>He evidently knew what it was best to do
under such circumstances, and his next exclamation
was uttered with even stronger
emphasis. He was, of course, doing something
in the steering line with his paddle-rudder,
and he had taken occasion to look
back along the wake of his dashing scow.</p>

<p>"What's this? Who ever knew that Green
Lake was so wide? I can't see the other
shore, toward our house. There isn't another
boat in sight, either. If I expect to get home
to-night, it's about time I went about, and
headed southerly. This is a curious piece of
business. I'll take in my lines, right away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>He shut up his book at once. There was
even an anxious tone in his voice, and an
exceedingly puzzled look upon his face. It
was such, perhaps, as the captain of a
line-of-battle-ship might wear upon finding
his huge fighting machine in unknown or
difficult navigation. Any experienced nautical
man would have been able to comprehend
Ned's unpleasant situation. That is,
perhaps so, if it had been at all possible
to know what was the precise nature of the
circumstances.</p>

<p>The lines came in fast enough and Ned
knew how to tack, if that were indeed the
correct thing for him to do next. Now, however,
came a second discovery, almost as perplexing
as the first. Behind him was a wide
waste of water without a visible shore, but
he was by no means out of sight of land
when he turned to look ahead. The northerly
shore of the lake was near, and it was
rapidly drawing nearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is tremendous!" he remarked, and
he took a tin cup out of his tackle-box, expressing
a hope that the lake water might
not prove too warm to drink.</p>

<p>He leaned over the side of the boat, still
gazing shoreward, scooped the cup full, and
began to drink like a very thirsty fellow.</p>

<p>"Faugh! Phew!" he suddenly sputtered,
and a vigorous, choking, coughing spell followed.
"What's this? Salt water? How
did Green Lake get salted!"</p>

<p>He tasted again, as if to make sure, and
then he looked around him utterly bewildered.
The shore was all the while drawing
nearer, and the water in his cup was of the
peculiar brackish flavour that belongs to the
great seas.</p>

<p>"Mountains?" he murmured. "I knew
there were high hills over this way, but I
never was told of anything like this. Right
along shore, too. Why, that cliff there's
as high as a church steeple. Higher. That's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
an eagle, too, circling around over the top
of it."</p>

<p>Was one side of Green Lake salt and the
other fresh, or had it in some mysterious way
broken through and become connected with
the Atlantic? It even occurred to him to
wonder, vaguely, if the lake had joined the
ocean in such a way that ships, the <i>Kentucky</i>,
for instance, could ever come steaming in,
firing salutes and astonishing all the country
people. His head was all a buzz of perplexing
questions, but he managed to keep hold of
his rudder, and speed onward toward the land.
In fact, the wind was now very good, and the
punt was running rapidly.</p>

<p>"Yonder," he remarked aloud, "is the
mouth of a kind of inlet. Those cliffs on
each side of it are awful. They're almost
perpendicular. It makes a fellow think of
some of those pictures of Norway fiords, in
the book. The best thing I can do is to steer
right in and find out what it is. Tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
what, though, I've sailed farther than I'd
any idea of."</p>

<p>He still had some distance to go before
reaching the opening between the tall cliffs,
and his eyes were busy. He tried the water
yet again, curiously.</p>

<p>"I know what sea water is," he thought.
"I tried it once, out in New York Bay. This
tastes salter than that did. Hullo! Those
are porpoises, tumbling around out yonder.
I've seen porpoises before, off Long Island,
when I went bluefishing with Uncle Jack.
I wish he were here to tell me what all this
amounts to. He knows a heap."</p>

<p>Perfectly stupendous were those beetling
promontories between which the boat sailed
in. They must have been several hundreds
of feet in height. Here and there, in the
clefts and crevices of their rugged sides and
along their summits, grew gigantic pines and
fir-trees.</p>

<p>"I'll put away the book," he said, "in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
locker under the back seat. I'm going ashore.
I want to find somebody that can tell me
what this means. I won't go home till I
know all about it. This isn't any kind of
cove, though. It runs away in."</p>

<p>So it did, narrow and deep, and it wound
around a rock corner, shortly, so that all
view of Green Lake behind him was cut off.
It was almost cool in there, as well as shadowy,
and Ned felt a kind of shudder going
over him. He was not exactly afraid, but
his heart was beating more quickly than
usual. He had put away the folio with
great care, and all of its four hundred and
seventy-five splendid illustrations seemed to
be running through his memory like a river
in a flood-time, after a rousing rain-storm.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed, at last. "There's
a landing-place! I can see boats and men
and women. Away off yonder, up the slope,
houses enough for a village. Hullo! That's
a ship at anchor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the village, as far as his eyes could
search, were more mountains, covered half-way
up with forests, but right here before
him the fiord widened so as to make a small
cliff-guarded harbour of the safest kind. It
was really a very beautiful place to visit, if
Ned had been at all able, just then, to admire
scenery.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought," he exclaimed,
"that a fellow could get to such a thing as
this is, just by crossing Green Lake!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChIVc" name="ChIV." id="ChIV.">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">BEHIND THE TIMES.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I <span class="smcap">wish</span> I had on a better rig," thought
Ned, very naturally. "I look like
anything."</p>

<p>He felt that he was going in among entire
strangers, and that he was not by any means
in company dress. He had come out fishing
in a pair of blue flannel trousers and a blue
woollen outing shirt, with canvas shoes, and
wearing the low, brown felt hat he had dived
in yesterday. It was dry now, but not handsome.
He lowered his sail and began to
paddle slowly along, thinking of all sorts of
things, and watching sharply for whatever
might turn up. He studied the sloop at
anchor, as he went past it, and declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
it was a queer enough craft to look at. It
was very long, and it was low amidships,
with big thole-pins along the rails, as if it
were planned to operate occasionally as a
rowboat. The stern of it rose very high, so
that it might contain a cabin, and so did the
bow. Projecting from the latter was an
iron-clad beak. It was chisel-edged, and
Ned remarked:</p>

<p>"That's a ram, but she doesn't look much
like a ship-of-war. Our ironclads have rams,
but they never get near enough to other
ships to strike with them. Our fighting has
to be done with long-range guns. Well! I
never saw her like before. Hullo! I see it!
She is made like the Norse pirate pictures in
that book! She is one of them!"</p>

<p>He was eager enough to go forward now,
and he rowed with his eyes at work in all
directions. The landing-place was now not
far ahead of him. It was provided with a
pretty substantial wharf, made of logs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
stones. From this a pier of similar construction
ran out about fifty feet into the harbour.
Upon the deck of the pier, and on the wharf,
and along the beach, were scattered men and
women, and there were a number of stout-looking
rowboats hitched here and there, or
pulled up on the shore.</p>

<p>Ned ceased rowing for a full half-minute
to stare intensely at the people, and then he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I guess I'm right about it. These chaps
are out and out Norsemen! That biggest
man wears an iron topknot, too, and he
carries a spear. Every man of 'em has a
short sword at his belt, and those are all what
the book calls seaxes. I know where I am
now. I'm in for it! But how on earth am I
ever to get home again in time for supper?"</p>

<p>That particular anxiety, and almost everything
else, was speedily driven out of his
head as he paddled his punt in among the
fishing-boats at the pier. It came very near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
astonishing him, however, that not a soul
among them seemed to be at all surprised
at seeing him. They paid him no especial
attention after they had hailed him, and after
he had replied to them in the language which
he had learned at home from old Erica. She
herself had told him that her speech was not
exactly the Norwegian of the printed books.
She could not even read them very well, for
she had been born up among the mountains
and fiords, where the country people still
talked the ancient Norse dialect, which could
sometimes hardly be understood by town folk.</p>

<p>That is, he knew already that Norway, in
that particular, was very much like parts of
England, Scotland, Ireland, and several other
countries.</p>

<p>As for the manner in which he was received,
it was possible that his rig, which had
made him nervous, was in his favour. He
was really very much better dressed than
were any of these fisher people. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
bowed to him politely, and he heard them
say something about his being a young jarl.
He had some idea of the meaning of that
term, but he did not just now feel like a
highly aristocratic boy.</p>

<p>The man who wore the long-nosed steel
cap and carried the spear was very busy
giving directions to the others, and was
evidently some sort of captain among them.
Just as Ned stepped from the pier to the
wharf, however, he saw something that almost
took his breath away, and he paid no
more attention to anything else.</p>

<p>"Isn't he splendid!" he exclaimed. "It's
the first time I ever saw a man in armour."</p>

<p>Not many paces away, and coming slowly
and with dignity, was a tall, gray-bearded,
powerful-looking Norseman. He carried no
shield, but he wore a coat of link-mail that
glittered in the sunshine. The spear in his
hand was long, with a straight blade that
was broad and brightly polished. His helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was open in front, and was ornamented on
top by a small pair of gilded wings. His
face was handsome, and he smiled very good-humouredly
as Ned stepped forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>"I am Vebba, son of Bjorn," he said.
"Thou art welcome. Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I am Ned Webb. I went out fishing,
and I came in by the fiord."</p>

<p>"Ned, son of Webb?" replied the Viking.
"Thou art of the south haven men. I know
them not well. Come thou to my house. I
will meet thy father when he cometh to the
gathering."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to come," said Ned, with
his best manners, but he was thinking, "Meet
my father? Well! I don't believe he will.
I've a pretty clear notion that father won't
be there."</p>

<p>"All mine have been fishing also," said
Vebba, as he turned to walk away, Ned following
with him. "Thou must know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
we are salting and smoking every fin we can
pull in, that the ships of Harold Hardrada's
fleet may not sail without plentiful provisions
when he and Tostig Godwinson harness
the steeds of the sea to bear the heroes
of the North to the conquest of England."</p>

<p>Ned's heart gave a great thump, and Vebba
must have noticed how his face flushed with
sudden delight, for he laughed loudly and
said to him:</p>

<p>"Thou art but young to join in a feast of
swords, but we will arm thee and thou shalt
sail with us to the shore of Britain. There
will be grand fighting when we close with
the Saxon host that will meet us under
Harold the King."</p>

<p>"That's just what I'd like to see!" exclaimed
Ned. "Of all things! I've always
wanted to conquer England, and now I'm to
have a tip-top chance. When do you all
expect to go?"</p>

<p>"It hath taken long to build ships," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Vebba. "The keels of Hardrada will
be fifteen score, and Tostig hath already as
many as three score with him at Bruges.
We wait, now, only for the outfitting. Let
us walk on to the house."</p>

<p>Ned had noticed that, with the exception
of Vebba, all whom he had yet seen were
barefooted. The chief, however,&mdash;for there
could be no doubt about his rank,&mdash;wore
sandals that were strapped to his feet and
ankles by broad thongs of leather. Most of
the other men wore leathern blouses, which
reminded Ned of some buckskin hunting-shirts
he had seen pictures of. The women
were supplied with gowns, some of which
were of coarse woollen stuff and some of
leather. All of the garments were more or
less fish-soiled, and not a few were ragged.
"No style here," thought Ned. "I wonder,
though, if a steel cap feels heavy on a fellow's
head. Perhaps it doesn't when one
gets used to it. Oh, but I'm glad I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
understand them. I'd be in the worst kind
of fix if I couldn't."</p>

<p>The fish which had been brought to the
shore in the boats were very fine. Ned saw
cod, haddock, herring, salmon, and some that
he was not familiar with. Heaviest of all
was a great porpoise they had speared and
that lay on the sand ready for cutting up
for war purposes. He had never before
heard of sea-pigs being eaten.</p>

<p>The village lay somewhat farther from the
landing than it had at first appeared, looking
at it from the water. It was in a narrow
valley between two rugged, mountainous
ridges, and all around it were broad fields of
cultivated land. Most of the houses were
low-roofed and small, constructed of logs
and stones and tempered clay that was
used to stop chinks and holes with. Three
or four of a better sort were built, in part
at least, of hewn logs and planks and pretty
fair-looking stone-work, but all were irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in plan and as if they had been builded at
random. Of these larger dwellings, the roofs
were high-pitched, differing altogether from
the mere cabins. Ned did not see any chimneys,
and he knew why, after his armoured
guide had led him into the most extensive
house, at the upper end of the village. It
was more like a collection of houses around
one huge affair in the middle, and this, when
he entered it, seemed to be all one room or
hall.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" thought Ned. "There's their
fireplace, in the middle of the floor, and the
smoke gets out at that hole in the roof, if it
can. Well, no, there isn't any floor but the
earth except at the end, away there at the
left. There's a pretty wide plank platform
there."</p>

<p>On this "dais," raised about a foot above
the hard beaten earth of the rest of the level,
he saw a long table, around which were
benches and chairs of various kinds. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
middle, behind the table, was one very high-backed
chair of oak, that was covered with
grotesque carving.</p>

<p>"That's the dinner-table," he said to himself.
"It's big enough for a New York hotel.
There are benches and bunks all around the
sides of the room. Six windows, too, and not
a sash in one of them. That's good enough
for summer, but what do they do in winter?"</p>

<p>He had to leave that question unsettled, so
many others were coming along. The earth
floor seemed to be as hard as stone, but it could
not have been swept recently. There were
neither carpets nor rugs, but in one corner he
saw a spinning-wheel and what looked like
a hand-loom for weaving. In another corner
was a strong stone-work, at the side of
which was an anvil, against which a large
bellows was leaning. The clothing he had
seen had told him that these people knew
what to do with wool and flax.</p>

<p>He was quickly compelled to cut off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
observations, for now a tall, handsome, yellow-haired
woman came forward and shook hands
with him, telling him that she was Wiltna,
the wife of Vebba. Following her were other
women, and at least a dozen of boys and girls,
whose several names he had a great deal of
difficulty in catching. He did best of all with
one tall, red-haired youngster of about his
own age.</p>

<p>"I am Lars, son of Vebba," he said, loudly.
"Come with me, and see the hawks and
hounds. Let us get away from so many
women. I am glad thou art come."</p>

<p>In an instant Ned began to feel at home.
What would he have done in a country where
there were no boys!&mdash;if there ever was such
a forlorn land as that.</p>

<p>He and Lars were like old friends in a
minute, but they had only to get out of the
house to see some of the dogs. A pair of tall,
ferocious-looking wolf-hounds came bounding
toward them, not barking, but uttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
strange, short howls of greeting, and showing
dangerous rows of sharp, white teeth. Lars
wrestled for a moment with one of them,
boxing the animal's ears fearlessly, and Ned
made friends with the other. On they all
went, then, to a low building behind the
house, from which a chorus of howls arose
as they drew near.</p>

<p>"Pups that are only half trained," said
Lars. "We have to keep 'em shut up. If
they and some of the older savages got out,
we might never see 'em again. They'd go
hunting on their own account, or they'd get
among the sheep; then they'd be worse than
wolves, for the shepherd dogs wouldn't fight
them."</p>

<p>It was hardly necessary for Ned to ask
questions, so eager was Lars to entertain him,
and to tell him the name and character of all
the dogs in all the kennels, older and younger.
They went to the stables, after that, and to a
paddock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Horses enough," thought Ned, "but only
a very few of them are large ones. Nanny
could run out of sight of anything I've seen
here. They're a clumsy-looking lot, and the
carts and the harness are all the roughest kind.
They don't seem to know what a buckle is,
and the wheels are a sight to see. They
make pretty good saddles, though. Now for
the hawks. I want to see 'em."</p>

<p>On went Lars to his bird-cages, beyond the
stables, and here was what Ned called "the
biggest kind of poultry show."</p>

<p>There were more than twenty falcons, of
all sorts, in Vebba's falconry. All of them
were leading dull and tedious lives, sitting on
perches, and several of them were not only
fettered but hooded. Lars transferred one
of these from its perch to his own wrist,
over which he wore a thick leather guard to
protect the skin from the sharp talons of the
bird.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he said. "I'll show thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
There won't be any game in sight, but I'll fly
him, and call him. I trained him myself. He's
a gerfalcon. Hardrada's brother gave him
to father after the fight with the pirates at
Croning's Fiord. Father killed five of them,
and took one of their boats. It was almost
big enough for a ship. It got sunk, though,
last winter, by the ice."</p>

<p>So they chatted, back and forth, as they
walked along together, away out of the village.
They met people who bowed and
greeted them, but no other boys seemed to
feel at liberty to join them. Ned learned,
afterward, that it was considered bad manners
for anybody to interfere with hawking
or any other kind of sport.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lars uttered a short, sharp cry,
as he looked upward, and the falcon began to
ruffle his feathers.</p>

<p>"A heron!" exclaimed Lars. "He is well
up, but my bird can reach him."</p>

<p>Off came the falcon's hood, and his brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
eyes winked rapidly as they were getting
accustomed again to the light.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a href="#withc" id="with">
<img class="border" src="images/image9.jpg" width="375" height="518" alt="&quot;WITH A STRONG MOTION THEN HE THREW HIS HAWK
UPWARD.&quot;" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">"WITH A STRONG MOTION THEN HE THREW HIS HAWK
UPWARD."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"He seeth!" shouted Lars. "I'll cast
him!" With a strong motion then he threw
his hawk upward, blowing a shrill screech
upon a bone whistle that hung by a cord of
braided leather around his neck.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" exclaimed Ned, as the beautiful
hawk spread his pinions and sailed swiftly
away. "He seeth the heron!"</p>

<p>His own eyes could not see the game very
well, so high in the air it was flying, and the
sunlight dazzled him.</p>

<p>Higher, higher, in great circles, the falcon
sped upward until he arose above the now
frightened and screaming heron.</p>

<p>"He will strike soon!" said Lars. "See!
He is swooping! He never faileth! He is
the king of gerfalcons!"</p>

<p>At that moment the falcon seemed to Ned
a mere speck against the sky, while the heron
was flying lower, as if its fear bore it downward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Then the speck above it disappeared
for a moment, so like a flash of lightning was
the unerring pounce of the well-trained bird
of prey.</p>

<p>"Struck! Well struck!" shouted Lars.
"Forward, now; we must be with them at
their falling."</p>

<p>It was not far that they had to run, and
Ned kept well abreast of his young Norse
comrade. He saw the hawk and the heron
strike the earth together, fluttering and
struggling, and then the game lay motionless.
Forward darted Lars, before the falcon
released the grip of his talons, and in a moment
more the bird's bright eyes were hooded
again.</p>

<p>"He shall not tear," said Lars. "It would
harm his training."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his favourite screamed angrily
as he was restored to the wrist of his master.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest," said Lars, "that no
hawk will come to a whistle when his talons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
are in. It is only when they miss that
thou canst call them back."</p>

<p>"Do your hawks ever miss?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Often," said Lars. "Or else there were
soon no more herons. All of these long-billed
fowl will fight, too. I have seen an old heron
kill a falcon, spiking him."</p>

<p>"I've read about it," thought Ned, "and
I'm glad I've seen it done. It's great!"</p>

<p>"Now, houseward," said Lars, picking up
the heron. "Didst thou ever slay a wild
boar?"</p>

<p>"I never did," confessed Ned.</p>

<p>"Then I am ahead of thee," exulted Lars.
"It was but a week ago that my two hounds
and I brought a fine one to bay in the
gorge of the north mountain thou seest
yonder. My father would have held me
back, had he been there, but I went in alone.
When the boar charged out, my spear went
through his heart and the hounds pulled
him down. Angry was Vebba, but he bade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the carles cut me out the tusks to keep for
a prize."</p>

<p>"There are wolves and bears in the forest
mountains?" inquired Ned.</p>

<p>"That there are, and many," replied Lars,
"but who would go taking them in the summer-time,
when their fur is short and thin?
No man careth for a bear-skin or a wolf-skin,
save in winter, when the fur is full upon
them. If thou art here next winter, I will
show thee sport. Ye people of the lower
fiords and the towns have small enjoyment,
I think, save in going to sea. This raid
on Britain is to be my first long voyage.
My father saith that thou art to sail with
us."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't miss it for anything," said
Ned. "Canst thou throw a spear?"</p>

<p>"I will show thee soon," said Lars. "But
I will not throw before the men lest they
say I am but young. How art thou with
a sword?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Try me!" exclaimed Ned. "I am better
with a sword than with a spear."</p>

<p>Then he remarked, to himself:</p>

<p>"I don't believe he ever had a better fencing-master
than I did. We'll see."</p>

<p>They were soon at the house, and, to Ned's
surprise, it was old Vebba himself who ordered
his son into what he called the house
of arms. It was only a kind of barn of split
logwork at the right of the central dwelling.
It had a good earthen floor, however, and its
walls inside were hung with many weapons.</p>

<p>"So," thought Ned, "is the great hall in
yonder. I'm going to take a good look at
them, by and by."</p>

<p>"Take this light shield," said Vebba to
Ned, "and this thin blade. It is heavy
enough for thee. Thou wilt first fence with
Svip, the son of Pend."</p>

<p>"No shield," said Ned, a little proudly,
putting it down on the floor. "Let him
punch away at me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Several grown-up Vikings were standing
around watching, and they all uttered exclamations
of surprise, but Svip, a youth as
tall as Lars, stepped promptly forward, sword
in hand. Neither of them wore armour, but
the shield of Svip was a pretty heavy weight
for a fencer to carry,&mdash;unless the other
fencer should also be weighted.</p>

<p>Svip was even irritated by something in
the confident manner of Ned, the son of
Webb, and he attacked vigorously, striking
and pushing. Of course it was not intended
that any hurt should be done. The
swords were blunt on edge and point, and
the hilts were basketed with strong steelwork.
On each boy's head was also a
thick bull-hide cap, serving as a helmet.
No blow of those dull blades could split such
a cap.</p>

<p>In half a minute there were loud exclamations
of admiration, for Ned's fencing-master
at home had indeed been a good one. Svip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the son of Pend, had no chance with him
whatever, for there was no science at all in
him. He was even forced across the room
with several hard raps upon his leathern
helmet, and then he was disarmed, his sword
flying from his hand.</p>

<p>"Thou art a young swordsman!" shouted
Vebba. "Thou mayest go with Hardrada.
Thy father will be proud of thee. Thou
shalt give Lars his lessons in thy skill of
fence. Try thou a spear."</p>

<p>Ned looked at the light javelins they
brought out, and he did not wish to let them
see how little he knew of spears; but a
wooden target was set, and the other boys
made their casts. It was his turn, and he
could not back out. He imitated their
manner of swaying and balancing, and then
he sent his javelin.</p>

<p>"All an accident," he thought, "but I
landed mine between theirs."</p>

<p>"Thou throwest well," said Vebba.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
"Take now a shield and let us see if thou
canst catch as well as throw."</p>

<p>Ned was silent, for at that moment Lars
stepped forth, shield on arm and spear in
hand, to let the other youngsters throw
headless javelins at him at ten paces.</p>

<p>"That's the way they do it, is it?" he
said, to himself, as Lars caught throw after
throw upon his shield, quite skilfully. "Any
baseball catcher can beat that. I'm the best
catcher in our nine. I can pitch, too. I can
stop one of those things."</p>

<p>It was his turn next. He did not actually
throw down the shield, this time, but he held
it close to him and parried with only his
spear-shaft the throws of Lars and the
others. Only one cast went by his guard
to ring against the shield.</p>

<p>"It is the better way," said Vebba. "It is
the skill of old warriors. I can catch the
spears of battle on sword or axe. Thou wilt
need the less armour. But who may parry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the swift arrow? Thou wilt need good mail
for English arrows."</p>

<p>Long and tiresome was the exercise, but it
terminated suddenly, for the sound of a horn
blast came loudly through the open door.</p>

<p>"Dinner!" exclaimed Lars. "Oh, Ned,
the son of Webb, all we are ready to eat. I
am ever glad to hear the sound of that
crooked horn. Let us go."</p>

<p>Whatever was Ned's reply in Norwegian,
his inner thought was, "I'm as ready as he
is."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChVc" name="ChV." id="ChV.">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE WAR SUMMONS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"T<span class="smcap">here</span>!" thought Ned, as he re&euml;ntered
the great central hall of Vebba's house.
"One of those other buildings that are stuck
on to this is their kitchen."</p>

<p>He saw several of the women coming in
with dishes through an open doorway near
him, and he stepped forward for a look at
the place from which they came. He saw no
cooking stove or range, but there was a charcoal
fire in the middle of the floor. Around
this were the cooks with kettles, gridirons,
and saucepans of entirely familiar shapes.
There was no smoke, and instead of it there
was an unpleasant smell of burning charcoal.
He noticed particularly that some of the cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
utensils had a brassy look, and he soon
afterward discovered that his new friends
knew how to do a great many things with copper
and bronze as well as with iron and steel.</p>

<p>Almost everybody was now hastening
toward the dinner-table on the dais. If,
under ordinary circumstances, noon might
be the dinner-hour, upon this occasion there
was a variation. Not only the fishermen of
the family, but several other persons, had but
just arrived, and this late meal was to be
something of an affair.</p>

<p>Sitting down at the table appeared to be a
matter of particular ceremony, and it quickly
aided Ned in understanding how minute and
sharp were the distinctions of social position
and rank among the Norsemen. They were
a free people, but for all that any man's ancestry,
his wealth, and his achievements in
war had much to do with the esteem in which
he was held and the place he might sit in.
Vebba himself was evidently of high degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and he took his seat in the high-backed
middle chair behind the table with great
dignity. At his right was Madame Vebba,
as Ned called her, or Wiltna, and at his left
was a short, black-haired woman who wore
a gold bracelet and a high cap. She might
be a guest of rank. After these, on either
hand, were seated men and women with
evident precision according to some rule.
Lars and Ned and other youths, not yet
considered especially distinguished, were at
the left end of the table, and a number of
young women and girls were at the right
end. There were many servants to fetch
and carry dishes.</p>

<p>"The plates are wooden!" said Ned.
"They won't break if you drop 'em. Some
of the cups and pitchers are of wood. Made
with hoops like little pails. They make all
sorts of pails. Horn cups, crockery, green
glass,&mdash;why don't they make window glass,
too?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>He had taken his seat by Lars, and the
first entirely thoughtless thing that he did
was to speak to one of the men waiters,
saying:</p>

<p>"Knife and fork, please."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lars. "I see! He hath
no cutter. Bring him a good blade."</p>

<p>Ned's cheeks were blazing. He had almost
forgotten that he was not at home.
There was not one solitary fork in the hall
of Vebba the chief.</p>

<p>"No!" he said aloud. "Nor a napkin,
nor a table-cloth, nor a potato!"</p>

<p>"I hear thee!" came suddenly in the deep
tones of Vebba. "Thou hast also been taught
other tongues. It is well. Thy father is wise
with thee. When the priest cometh he shall
talk with thee in Latin, for we understand
him not very well."</p>

<p>"That's it!" thought Ned. "I spoke in
English. What'll I do with Latin?"</p>

<p>Then he replied to Vebba:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will be glad to see the priest."</p>

<p>"We like him well," said Wiltna. "He is
from Ireland, where there are many such as
he, and he cometh here to teach against the
old gods of the North. Most of the people
swear by Wodin and Thor to this day. They
change not easily."</p>

<p>Ned did not say anything aloud about their
being heathen, but he blurted out in Norwegian:</p>

<p>"It is just so among us; we have ever so
many preachers, and most of the people do
not go by what they say any too well."</p>

<p>Vebba nodded, as if that were understood
to be a matter of course everywhere, and the
dinner went on.</p>

<p>"How they do drink beer!" thought Ned.
"Nothing else. Every fellow uses his own
sheath-knife and his fingers. Salt, but no
pepper. Fair butter. Pretty good bread.
This is goat mutton, is it? I like it pretty
well. I guess there won't be any pie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Fingers were made before forks, as Uncle
Jack says."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the table manners were very
good, and the food was abundant, fish, flesh,
and fowl. The fish, especially, were all that
could be asked for, and the poultry was wild
game of several kinds.</p>

<p>Now and then a remark from Vebba or
Wiltna came to Ned, politely, but he was left
to Lars and the other youngsters most of
the time. It was manifestly against the rules
of good Norse society to ask too many questions
of a guest. Strangers were welcome to
come and go, and would simply be treated
according to their degree while there. In
fact, much of the respect with which Ned
was now regarded by his new friends belonged
to the fact that he had learned so
much from his American fencing-master,&mdash;and
he, too, had been French.</p>

<p>The dinner ended for the aristocratic part
of the household, all of lower degree getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
their provision afterward, or in other houses
or outer rooms.</p>

<p>It could be seen that this day was of some
unusual interest. Other men were arriving,
one by one, and they came in armour, bringing
weapons with them. While they were
being welcomed by their hosts, Ned had a
good opportunity for his proposed examination
of the ornaments of the walls of the
hall.</p>

<p>Great antlers, fastened here and there,
served as hooks on which to hang things, and
all were heavily loaded. There were helmets
of many patterns; shields of all sorts; coats
of mail; pieces of armour; coats of thick
leather, with or without plates of metal before
and behind; short-handled and long-handled
battle-axes, with single-edged and
double-edged blade-heads of curious shapes;
spears, heavy and light, and swords, some of
which seemed as if they were made for
giants, for they were almost as long as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
man. In one corner lay several bundles or
sheaves of arrows, and there were plenty of
bows.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I could bend some of those
bows," thought Ned. "I'd rather have a
revolver, anyhow, or a repeating rifle that
would carry a mile. It would send a bullet
through one of those coats of mail, or a shield,
either."</p>

<p>He was called away from his tour of observation
by a sudden sound of music. He
whirled upon his feet to see, and there in
front of the table, on the dais, sat four old
men with harps, which they were tuning,
getting ready to play. At the same time the
hall was growing lighter. It had been somewhat
dusky, but now a strong glare was
reddening over the walls and the black rafters
of the roof. The servants had brought in
upright, three-legged cressets of iron-work.
That is, at the top of the upright stem of
each of these tripod cressets was an iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
basket, into which fragments and knots of
pine and fir were fed, as they burned. These
were the chandeliers of the dwelling of Vebba,
and they answered remarkably well.</p>

<p>"No candles to snuff," thought Ned, "but
I'd rather have electric light, or coal gas, or
kerosene. Hullo! They're going to work at
the forge. I wonder if every man around
here has a blacksmith shop in his own house."</p>

<p>Probably not, considering how very costly
a thing an anvil and a lot of hammers and
chisels and files might be. Only a rich chief
could afford such an affair as was that forge
in the house of Vebba. There was a charcoal
fire upon its masonry now, however, and a
brawny, grimy man in a leather coat was
holding a piece of steel in it with tongs, while
another man worked the bellows.</p>

<p>Then the four harpers struck up, and at
once the smith began to sing. Out came his
white-hot piece of steel to the anvil, up went
a hammer in his strong right hand, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
thudding blows that he struck kept time with
the music and with the cadences of his anvil-song:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">"I forge a sword;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I hammer steel;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">It shall cleave shields,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Going through mail.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">By it shall men fall.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hammer! Hammer! Hammer! So do</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I shape the steel for the battle."</span><br />
</p>

<p>The smith had a rich, deep, musical voice,
and the hall was filled with a great roar of
song when all the other voices in it joined in
the hammer chorus at the end of each stanza.
Somewhat slowly the meaning of it all began
to dawn upon the mind of Ned, the son of
Webb. This was not mere forge-work; not
the manufacture of one blade more at this
time; it was part of the entertainment of the
evening, and there was an increasing excitement
among the Vikings as the singing and
harping and hammering went on.</p>

<p>"It is grand!" thought Ned. "Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
else is coming, I know there is. Hullo!
What's that?"</p>

<p>Instantly all the great chorus died away,
and every face was turned toward the open
outer door of the hall. Through this doorway
had come a fiercely ringing blast of a
powerfully blown war-horn, and now, striding
forward three paces into the hall, was a
broad-shouldered, splendidly armoured warrior,
carrying shield and ax.</p>

<p>"Ho, Vebba, son of Bjorn!" he shouted.
"Hearken thou and thine to the summons of
Harold Hardrada the King! All is ready for
Britain, save this last of thy keels. Let it
follow thee. Be thou at the seaside the third
day hence, and bring with thee every sword
and spear of thy house."</p>

<p>"Hail!" shouted back Vebba, joyfully.
"Hail to thee and to thy message from
Harold Hardrada! Bide thou with me this
night, O messenger of the king."</p>

<p>"Not I, Vebba the chief," loudly responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the warrior at the door. "One horn of ale
I will drink, for thy welcome. Then go I
onward, for the summons is hasty, and the
steeds of the sea are already harnessed. I am
bidden to say to thee and to all, that the hosts
of the Northland and the lithsmen of Tostig
Godwinson the Earl must be in England to
claim the land for their own before the
muster of William of Normandy can cross the
sea to land in south Britain. It is to be ours,
and not theirs, to cut down the Saxons of
Harold the King. Hail to Harold Hardrada!
Hail to the winning of England by the heroes
of the Northland! My message is done."</p>

<p>A huge silver-mounted horn cup, foaming
with ale, was brought to him. He drank it
standing, and it appeared to be out of order
to ask him further questions. At the same
time, however, all the excited warriors present
were loudly repeating to each other the
substance of this war news.</p>

<p>Away strode the messenger, whose name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
escaped the ears of Ned, the son of Webb,
and as he departed the harpers once more
struck up a roaring battle-song. The women
were as excited as the men, and many of
them had excellent voices.</p>

<p>"This is splendid!" exclaimed Ned, and at
that moment a heavy hand was laid upon his
arm.</p>

<p>"Come thou with me," said one of the
older warriors. "It is by the order of Vebba,
the chief. I will show thee thy arms and
armour, and then thou wilt go to thy rest.
We are to march in the morning."</p>

<p>"Horses for thee and me," interrupted
Lars, at the side of the old Viking. "It is
but six leagues to ride. Then we take ship.
There will be many carts, also."</p>

<p>"All right!" exclaimed Ned, in English,
and then he corrected himself and replied
in Norwegian, as he followed them to the
house of arms.</p>

<p>Both of them carried pine-knot torches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and when Ned turned at the doorway to look
back upon the Vikings, the women, and the
harpers, he thought he had never seen anything
else half so wonderful. The men had
caught weapons and shields from the antlers
on the walls, and these, as well as the anvil
and hammer, were now clanging time to the
music and its choruses.</p>

<p>It was only a few steps farther, and then
Ned, the son of Webb, was feverishly examining
his new metallic clothing. The helmet
handed him was of bronze. It was plainly
made, without any crest, like one which Lars
showed him as his own, and it had a nose-piece
in front as well as a back neck-piece
behind. He put it on, and it did not hurt, for
it was lined with padded deer-skin. Next
Lars held up before him, to measure his size,
a beautiful coat of linked-steel mail, not too
heavy, and polished till it looked like silver.</p>

<p>"Thou and I must wear our mail at once,"
he said, "to get used to it. Even old fighters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
need to harden a little, after a long peace.
Put it on, but first put on the leather shirt,
for thy blue cloth is too thin."</p>

<p>"It would wear to holes in no time," said
Ned, and he pulled on over his outing shirt
another of soft goat-leather.</p>

<p>It was a genuine pleasure, then, to find that
his splendid mail hauberk was a capital fit,
and did not pinch him at any part. The belt
by which his sword-sheath was to be suspended
had also a strap to go over his right
shoulder, the better to sustain the weight.
It had a very good buckle, too, and he wondered
why they did not use better buckles on
their harness.</p>

<p>He drew his sword from the sheath to look
at it, and was delighted. It was a slightly
curved short sabre, sharp on one edge and at
the point, with a steel cross-hilt that had no
guard.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest how to use a sword," said
the old Viking, pleasantly. "Thou wilt be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
a jarl, some day. These are thy spears and
thy shield and thine ax. Fight thou well before
the eyes of Harold Hardrada and the sea
kings, for thou and Lars are but young to
face Saxons."</p>

<p>The two spears, longer and shorter, were
of the best. The ax was short-handled, but
was heavy enough to need both of Ned's
hands to swing it well. The shield was
round, steel-rimmed, of thick, hard-faced
hide, having thongs within for a left arm to
pass through. The other armour consisted of
light steel leg and arm pieces, and shoulder-bars
that would stop a pretty strong sword-cut.</p>

<p>"Now we are ready," said Lars. "Thou
and I have nothing to do with bows and
arrows. Neither thy arm nor mine can bend
a battle-bow. Not one man in ten can bend
the bow of Vebba, the son of Bjorn, and the
bow of Hardrada the Sea King is as a bow
of steel. It sendeth an arrow through the
side of a ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess not," thought Ned. "Not, anyhow,
if she were an American ironclad.
What is all this armour compared to our
two-foot steel plates? I'm glad I'm to have
a horse, though. I don't believe Nanny
would let me mount her if I came up to
her in this rig."</p>

<p>He was to take it all off now, however,
and carry it with him to the room in which
he was to sleep. This was in a small house
that opened at one corner into the main
dwelling or hall. In it, around the sides,
were four broad benches, upon each of
which were wolf-skins and a straw pillow.
Two of these bench-bunks were already
occupied by sleepers, and down went
Lars upon another, after putting out his
torch.</p>

<p>"That's it, is it?" said Ned, to himself.
"Well, it's bed enough for a soldier, I suppose.
I'll do just as he did."</p>

<p>His mail and arms were laid upon the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and his helmet was placed upon them. Tired,
exceedingly tired, he stretched himself upon
his wolf-skin, and the old Viking walked out,
carrying his torch with him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChVIc" name="ChVI." id="ChVI.">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE SEA KING.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">hrough</span> a sashless window, the next
morning's light came into the room where
Ned was sleeping, and woke him. With it
poured in the dull roar of the ocean waves
upon the rocky coast of Norway.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he exclaimed, sitting up
and looking around him. "Where am I? I
say, what would father and mother think of
this? Well, I begin to remember it all now!
There's Lars. I saw his hawks and the dogs
and all the rest. Then came the blacksmith
business and the songs and the harping. I
know where I am! I'm a Viking, and I heard
the messenger from King Hardrada. Hurrah!
I'm going to invade England! Just the very
thing I've always wanted to do!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He was on his feet now, picking up his
arms and armour. His exclamations and the
clatter he was making aroused the other
sleepers. They, too, sprang up with shouts
of warlike enthusiasm, and began to talk
eagerly about the mustering of the army.
They helped one another with the mail and
the pieces of armour, for clothing of that style
had peculiar difficulties of its own. Their
hero was Hardrada the Sea King, and they
had wild tales to tell of his exploits and
adventures half-way around the world.</p>

<p>"He went almost to the edge of it, once,"
said Lars. "I'd like to go there, myself, and
see where the sky touches the earth. It's as
hard as a brick and has star-holes in it, but
you can't climb through."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know that the earth is round,"
thought Ned, "but he will, some day. What
he needs is the primary and then four years
in a grammar school. I want to see Hardrada,
and then I'd like a good look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Harold of England and William the Norman."</p>

<p>Out they went to breakfast, and all the
while Ned learned more and more about
the great invasion. It was to be made by
the largest force that ever had sailed from the
Northland. Even Knud the Great, the conqueror
of England, had never gathered such a
fleet. He was a Dane, indeed, but all sorts
of Northmen had gone with him, or he would
have been beaten by the Saxons.</p>

<p>There was no order at the breakfast-table
except that of first come first served, and
nobody lingered long.</p>

<p>Ned's next errand carried him to a place
from which he could see the landing, and he
watched the boats that were busily plying to
and from the ship.</p>

<p>"They're loading her as fast as they
can," he remarked. "I'd rather go by land.
There'll be sea-going enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud summons from Lars interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
him, and in a few minutes more they were
among a considerable drove of saddled and
bridled horses.</p>

<p>"Some of them are big ones," he said,
"but Lars and I are to ride ponies."</p>

<p>Vebba himself was very well mounted, and
he was riding around, in full armour, giving
orders to his men. These were several scores
in number, and they were a ferocious-looking
crew. Their arms and equipments were of
all sorts, for each man had suited himself,
and nothing like a uniform was called for by
the army regulations. Most of them were
tall fellows, but there were also a number of
short, broad-shouldered, powerful-looking
fighters, with dark skins and black hair, who
almost seemed to belong to some other race.</p>

<p>"Who are those fellows?" replied Lars,
when Ned asked about them. "Why, knowest
thou not who they are? They belong to the
old race that was here when Woden and Thor
and our people came in here from the east.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
They are all miners. They live among the
mountains, and some of them are wizards.
They are good fighters, though, and they
never spare an enemy."</p>

<p>Terrible, indeed, were their hard, cruel
faces. One of them, in particular, had a kind
of fascination for Ned, he was so tremendously
broad-shouldered and long-armed, and seemed
so strong. It was enough to make one
shudder to look at him and see him move.
There could not have been an ounce of fat on
him, but he must have weighed over two
hundred pounds. For all that, however, he
stepped around as lightly as a fourteen-year-old
catcher in a game of baseball.</p>

<p>"He is worth a hundred common men,"
explained Lars. "He is Sikend, the Berserker,
and no spear can hit him. He can catch an
arrow on his ax-edge and he can cleave a
steel helmet as if it were made of pine.
There isn't any Saxon that can stand before
him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned and his friends were quickly mounted,
and were riding away in a southerly direction.
Vebba remained behind to bring on the main
body of his following, while a score of his best
men went forward with his son. To him he
said, at parting:</p>

<p>"Get speech with the king. Say to him
that I and mine are coming. Say that I have
sent on great store of provisions and three
more good keels wherewith he may ferry his
levies. Go!"</p>

<p>Everybody seemed in good spirits, but there
was a kind of excitement which was in the
way of conversation. Even the women at
the house and in the village were cheerful.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he thought, "they may do
some crying when the men go, but Lars says
that the Norway women can fight. His
mother killed a wolf once. I wouldn't like
to have my mother go out for wolf-killing.
Wouldn't she run! So would the girls or
Aunt Sally. Oh!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>He and Lars were now riding together at
the rear of their little company, and just then
he heard the sound of galloping hoofs behind
him. He turned his head to look, and a horseman
wearing a long black robe and a peculiar
cap reined in at his side, exclaiming loudly, in
Latin:</p>

<p>"Thou art Ned, the son of Webb. I am
Brian, the missionary, from the Clontarf
School and Abbey in blessed Ireland. Good-will
to thee!"</p>

<p>Ned summoned up all the Latin he had
ever worked upon, but there was danger of its
falling somewhat short. He had begun with
it early, and Uncle Jack and his father had
bored him horribly with it, year after year,
making him talk it as well as read it. He
could, therefore, really do something in this
sudden emergency, but he was willing to say
little and to let the rosy-faced and friendly
priest do most of the talking,&mdash;which he was
ready to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, my son!" he remarked to Ned.
"These men of the North are no better than
heathen. They are not at all civilised Christians
such as we have in Ireland. Even after
they are converted, they stick to their old
gods,&mdash;such as they are. They are all murderous
pirates, anyhow. If it were not for
the like of them and the Danes there would
be peace and prosperity in Ireland all the
while. Even the Saxons trouble us less than
do the Danes and the Jutlanders and the
sea kings."</p>

<p>Ned was entirely able to ask questions, and
he was likely to learn a great deal concerning
the piety and enlightenment of the land of
St. Patrick, the land of education, from which
more missionaries were going out than from
any other. Already had they done wonders
for the English and Scotch and similar idolaters.
Alfred the Great, said Father Brian,
had welcomed the Irish scholars gladly, giving
them houses and lands and cattle. Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the Confessor had also done well by them,
and the present King of England, Harold, the
son of Godwin, had been their friend when
as yet he was only an earl.</p>

<p>"What if Hardrada and Tostig are going
to beat him?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"That is yet to be determined," replied
Father Brian, thoughtfully. "They may
indeed divide the island of Great Britain with
Duke William of Normandy. He is a pious
man. He speaketh Latin. He will bring
with him shiploads of teachers and missionaries.
He will build churches and found
schools, as he hath already done in Normandy.
It hath been on my mind that these Vikings
may but cripple the Saxons and open the way
for William the Norman."</p>

<p>"King Harold of England is said to be a
hard fighter," suggested Ned.</p>

<p>"Thou art but a boy," exclaimed Father
Brian. "I was a soldier once, myself. Mark
thou! Harold fighteth with two at a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
instead of with one enemy only, and each of
the twain is his equal, I think. I hear that
the English themselves are little more than
half-hearted for Harold. Were there not
seven kingdoms of them not so long ago?
They are a bundle of sticks that is badly tied
together."</p>

<p>Somehow or other, although Ned was now
one of Hardrada's warriors, he felt a strong
feeling of admiration, if not of sympathy,
growing in him for Harold of England. The
Saxon king was to be forced to defend the
northern and southern ends of his kingdom
at the same time, and there was no fairness in
it. A great deal that he was hearing was
new to him, but he could dimly remember
having read something somewhere concerning
the great development of the early Irish
Church.</p>

<p>"St. Patrick himself set it going," he said,
thoughtfully, "but Father Brian doesn't seem
to know much about him. Perhaps his biog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>raphy
hasn't been published there yet. As
soon as it is, he'd better get a copy and
read it."</p>

<p>Something like that idea was wandering
around in his mind when he spoke to Father
Brian in modern English concerning the telegraphic
reports of Harold Hardrada's landing
in England.</p>

<p>"What's that thou art saying, my boy?"
sharply inquired the missionary, in good
Clontarf Latin. "Change thy tongue."</p>

<p>Ned strove to explain the matter, but he
found himself altogether at sea, for his
reverend friend had not the smallest idea
concerning either printing or electricity.</p>

<p>"It's the lightning, is it?" he gruffly remarked.
"Let me tell thee, then, thou wilt
get little good out of that."</p>

<p>Ned was silenced completely, and gave the
matter up.</p>

<p>"It's a curious piece of business," he
thought. "I have been living in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
world than his. The world that he and all
these others live in is pretty near a thousand
years behind time. I wish I could give them
a photograph of the <i>Kentucky</i> or show them
an express train going sixty miles an hour."</p>

<p>He and the Vikings were going along at
pony trot, and he was discovering that a steel
mail overcoat, put on over leather and flannel,
was a pretty warm kind of summer clothing.</p>

<p>"I wonder if a fellow ever gets used to
it!" he remarked to Father Brian. "Those
Vikings don't seem to mind it much. They're
all iron-clad, too, like so many war-steamers."</p>

<p>"There was never mail made yet," replied
the good man, "but something would
go through it. I've split a shield with a
pole-ax."</p>

<p>He was looking somewhat unpeaceful, just
then, for his pony was kicking.</p>

<p>"Even a Berserker, though," said Ned,
"would want no bearskin shirt to-day."</p>

<p>"They never wear them," said the mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>sionary.
"Thou art all wrong with the
name. The word Ber meaneth bear, that's
so, but some weak minds will spell it b-a-r-e,
as if they'd fight in their linen, if they had
any. No more do they take bearskins for
mail."</p>

<p>"What do they, then?" asked Ned, in
Latin.</p>

<p>"Like other men," said the priest, hotly.
"The meaning is that they're descended
from bears, and fight like wild beasts. There
are other opinions, indeed, but mine is as
good as any other man's, any day."</p>

<p>Perhaps that was a good enough reason for
sticking to his own notions and lashing his
pony into good behaviour. At all events, Ned
did not contradict him. He was just then
recalling the savage countenance of Sikend
the Berserker, and it had reminded him of a
grizzly bear he had seen in the Central Park
menagerie.</p>

<p>"It's the same expression in the eyes,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
he said to himself, "but the old grizzly
had a better-tempered look than Sikend
has."</p>

<p>On went the cavalcade, halting at noon for
a rest and for luncheon. Only an hour or so
after that they halted again on the crest of a
ridge. Beyond this lay a wide, deep valley,
bordered westerly by the blue waters of the
North Sea. With one accord the Vikings
raised an enthusiastic shout, and clashed their
spears against their shields.</p>

<p>"The host of Hardrada the Sea King!"</p>

<p>"The hundred keels of Norway!"</p>

<p>"The flag of the World Waster!"</p>

<p>"Hail to the banner of Woden!"</p>

<p>"Hail to Harold Hardrada!"</p>

<p>"The spears will be many and sharp!"</p>

<p>"Swords will cleave helms!"</p>

<p>"Axes will break the mail of the Saxons!"</p>

<p>The war-cries of the men of Vebba, young
and old, were fierce and exulting as they
gazed down upon the valley and out upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sea. Scattered upon all the slopes and levels
and along the shore were the houses of a
considerable town. At the upper end of the
valley, and also at the right of the very
commodious harbour, were what looked like
extensive fortifications. These were composed
mainly of strong palisade works, surrounded
by ditches or moats. Nowhere was to be
seen anything like a castle of stone. In the
open spaces, everywhere, were tents and
booths. These must now have been empty,
for the afternoon sun glittered upon the
polished arms and armour of long lines and
serried columns of warriors drawn up in
battle array as if for inspection.</p>

<p>"Ships! Ships! Ships!" exclaimed Ned.
"Scores and scores of them, big and little. I
don't see any square-rigged ships, with yards
and topsails, but a good many of them have
two masts and some have three or four.
They are all single sticks without topmasts,
and with brig and schooner rigging. I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
know better what they are like after I get
down among them."</p>

<p>Now came up from the valley a loud sound
of harping and the braying of thousands of
war-horns, followed by a great shout that
ran along the lines as one body of troops
after another caught its meaning and passed
it on.</p>

<p>"On, men! Ride forward! Lars, son of
Vebba, yonder cometh King Hardrada. He
revieweth his army before it goeth on ship-board.
Thou wilt hasten to deliver to him
the greeting of thy father. Let Ned, the son
of Webb, ride with thee. I go to the shore
speedily, to seek our shipping. This errand
is thine." So spoke the veteran warrior in
charge of this party of Vebba's men, and all
rode rapidly onward.</p>

<p>"This is awful!" thought Ned. "I hope
the king will have little to say to me. I
wouldn't know what on earth is the correct
way of talking back to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not have many minutes more of
riding, nevertheless, before Lars, the son of
Vebba, said to him:</p>

<p>"Pull in, Ned. We will halt at the right
front of this nearest square of men, and wait
for the king. See thou! He and his jarls
and captains come this way. I am not of
full age that I may ride to meet him."</p>

<p>Only a man of rank or a warrior of fame,
it appeared, might presume to go out in front
of the lines to greet the royal company, and
Ned began at once to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>"I will keep a little back," he said to Father
Brian. "We will let Lars do the talking."</p>

<p>"That will not I!" exclaimed the rosy-faced
Irishman. "Any half-heathen king
like him is no better than the rest of us;
besides that, I am a missionary from Clontarf.
I will speak my mind to him."</p>

<p>He consented, however, to halt with the
rest and wait for the king to come.</p>

<p>Loud rang the cheers and war-cries, fiercely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
brayed the war-horns, as the great Sea King
rode slowly nearer. His keen, flashing blue
eyes were searching the array of his warriors,
man by man, and rank by rank, while his
proud face flushed with exultation. Never
before had any monarch of the North gathered
such a mustering of the best fighting men of
the broad flat earth.</p>

<p>Hardrada was almost a giant in size, being
said to measure over seven feet, and to be
strong in proportion. His armour was richly
ornamented with gold and jewels. His gilded
head-piece had no visor in front to hide his
features, and his abundant, bright red hair,
from which he took his name, flowed down
his shoulders in a mass of ripples, instead of
being worn in braids like those of numbers
of his followers. At his saddle-bow was slung
a huge battle-ax, which few arms but his could
wield. From his belt hung a long, straight
sword, in a jewelled sheath. His broad, round,
gorgeously decorated shield was thrown over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
his shoulder. In his hand was a long spear,
not unlike the lances which were carried by
the men-at-arms of France and Normandy.</p>

<p>"Isn't he magnificent!" exclaimed Ned.
"Hurrah! I have seen the greatest of the
Vikings, Lars! The Saxons will find him a
hard man to meet. Who is that other man
at his side? He is almost as splendid as the
king."</p>

<p>"That must be Tostig the Earl," said Lars.
"They said he was away with his ships, but
he hath come to talk with Hardrada. He is
a brother of Harold Godwinson, the King of
the Saxons. Men say he is a good fighter,
but not so good as his brother. What a
match it would be between the two Harolds
of Norway and England!"</p>

<p>"That's so!" said Ned. "Or between
Tostig the Earl and Sikend the Berserker."</p>

<p>"No man on earth is a match for Sikend,"
said Lars. "He beareth a charmed life.
There are witches and wizards among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
people. They read the old runes on the
tombstones. They boil snakes and lizards
and evil roots, to make charms with, and salve
ointments for hurts. Some of them can
make a sword-cut close up and heal over, but
I think I would not be smeared with any
witch grease."</p>

<p>"Salve is a good thing for a cut," said Ned.
"It's good for a burn, too. You can find
out the right thing from the advertisements.
I don't remember any liniment, though, that
they said was made of snake-fat. They
couldn't get snakes enough, I guess, unless
they raised them themselves."</p>

<p>The reviewing party of great men, headed
by the king and the earl, halted as it reached
the head of the column, with which Vebba's
men were posted. Its captain had not yet
left it, and the king may have known him by
sight, for he at once beckoned him forward.</p>

<p>With him rode out Lars, Father Brian, and,
by their direction, Ned, the son of Webb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak," said Hardrada to the warrior.
"What word hast thou for me?"</p>

<p>"It is not mine," he replied. "O king,
Lars, the son of Vebba, will deliver unto thee
the greeting from his father."</p>

<p>"Let it be brief," said the king. "Time
passeth."</p>

<p>"O Harold the King," spoke Lars, freely
and boldly, "my father bade me greet thee
with this, that all swordsmen are ready.
They march this day to join thee. The last
of the provision ships lifteth her anchor at
sunset. He himself cometh with the miners
and the mountain men."</p>

<p>"It is well," said Hardrada. "I know the
value of thy father. Who is the youth with
thee? O priest, hold thou thy peace!"</p>

<p>"That will I not," responded Father Brian,
sturdily. "I have first this word for thee
that came by sea. Haste, thou and thine, or
William the Norman will reach England
before thee. This do I speak for thy good, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
thou art able to take friendly advice, like a
man of sense."</p>

<p>"Thou art late with thy warning," grimly
responded the king. "Well did I know that
matter, already. Nevertheless, I will freely
hear it from thee. Thou hast spoken loyally.
And now I would know concerning the youth
that is with the son of Vebba."</p>

<p>It had come to pass, by the way, as they
rode hitherward, that Ned, the son of Webb,
had given to the missionary the Latin charter
name of the American city that he came from,
and from it a somewhat crooked understanding
had arisen, for Eboricum is nothing but
York, whether new or old. Therefore his
reverend friend at once replied for him:</p>

<p>"He is Ned, the son of Webb, the chief, or
it might be he is somewhat of a jarl. He is
an Angle, and he cometh from York. And a
fine boy he is, if I say it myself."</p>

<p>The next remark came promptly from Tostig
the Earl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Harold the King, my friend, did I not
tell thee of my many faithful adherents in
my earldom of Northumberland and in mine
own city of York? He is welcome. He
shall sail with us, and we shall be joined
by many more as soon as our standards are
seen at the Humber. I pray thee, for the
present, let him remain with Vebba, his
friend."</p>

<p>"It is well," said the king. "What sayest
thou, Ned, the son of Webb?"</p>

<p>"O king," said Ned, hoping that he was
bowing correctly, although he nearly pitched
out of the saddle in doing it, "I will do as
Tostig the Earl hath said. Lars and I are
chums. I would give much to see Sikend
the Berserker in a battle. I would like to
see thee fight also, O King Hardrada, or
Tostig the Earl."</p>

<p>Loudly laughed the red-haired king, and as
loudly roared Tostig and other of the great
warriors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well spoken!" shouted Hardrada. "Thou
shalt have thy will in that matter."</p>

<p>"O Hardrada the King," interposed Vebba's
captain, "I will say this for him, that he is
the best sword, for his age, that I ever saw,
and he catcheth a flying spear like an old
fighter."</p>

<p>"I like him well," said Tostig. "So let
him show the Northmen of what sort are my
men of Northumberland. It is a good thing
that he hath done, to even flee from York to
join us as we sail."</p>

<p>No more was said, and the royal party rode
slowly on along the lines.</p>

<p>"I'm out of that scrape, tip-top," said Ned
to himself, as he and his friends wheeled
back to their post at the head of the Viking
column. "But what explanation can I give
if we ever get to old York? It beats me
all hollow."</p>

<p>At that moment the old Viking at his side
said to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"I go, now, to the shore. Thou hast a
strong friend in Tostig the Earl. I am glad
to know this much more concerning thee and
thine. We were questioning much in our
minds as to how we might deal with thee,
and some said it were well to take off thy
head. It is ever wise to make sure of all
comrades who march with us, for at times
there have been false companions."</p>

<p>Ned was silent, for he was not pleased with
the suggestion concerning his head, and the
warrior rode away.</p>

<p>A few hours later, Vebba arrived with another
force of his men, and he expressed great
gratification upon learning that he would now
be under no necessity for giving an account
of his young friend.</p>

<p>"Aha!" he exclaimed. "The youth appertaineth
to Tostig the Earl, and he biddeth
him to remain with me. He is the son of a
Saxon under-jarl. I am glad to be upon
better terms with Tostig."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore it was duly settled in the minds
of all men, and Ned was acknowledged as
being the right sort of youth to associate
with Vikings of good degree. The review
having been finished, the army had scattered
to its camps. Vebba's men had been assigned
an open space a little north of the town, and
to this his first detachment had marched.
Their first duty was to prepare all things for
further arrivals, and this work began, of course,
with the kindling of camp-fires. Fuel enough
had been provided, and Ned at once discovered
something that was new to him.
The making of a fire was an affair of toil
and trouble. He saw his comrades carefully
splitting splinters and hunting for handfuls
of dry grass.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he thought, "but just
look at that fellow hammering out sparks
with his flint and steel. It'll take him all
night! Why doesn't he go for an old newspaper
and some matches?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The mailed stoker did nothing of the kind,
and his sparks fell vainly upon his insufficient
tinder.</p>

<p>"That's it!" exclaimed Ned. "What a
stupid I am! There isn't a box of matches
in all the world! I guess I'll show them a
point they don't know. I've a whole box of
lighters in my pocket.&mdash;Now! I won't let
one of them see just what I am doing. It's
a good joke."</p>

<p>The would-be fire maker was getting disgusted
with his bad success, and he was standing
erect at the moment when Ned stooped
and put something into the little heap of pine
splinters. Nobody had seen him scratch his
match upon a stone, and, in a moment more,
all eyes turned curiously to stare at the sudden
blaze which sprang up so brightly as the
resinous fuel kindled.</p>

<p>"It is the work of the young Saxon of
Tostig the Earl!" one of them said.</p>

<p>"Ay!" remarked another. "He hath rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
skill with a flint. Who ever saw such fire
making? He hath been well taught."</p>

<p>He was thenceforth to be admired and
valued, for one who could kindle camp-fires
readily was a welcome comrade in a campaign.
Ned also learned from their talk that in a Norway
dwelling great care was always taken to
keep fire from day to day, the whole year
round. If the fire of one household should at
any time be extinguished, it was better to send
elsewhere and bring to it a torch, from even a
considerable distance, than to toil over the
creation of a brand new blaze with flint and
steel.</p>

<p>"It only cost me one match," thought Ned.
"I'll be stingy about burning the rest. They
may last me clean through the conquest of
England, if I'm careful. Old newspapers are
the right thing to start fires with, though, and
I can't even get an old school-book to tear
up."</p>

<p>Tents there were none for Vebba's men, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the night was clear and warm, and the
supposed favourite of Tostig, the great
Earl, slept like a top in his first bivouac
as a soldier in the army of Hardrada the
Sea King.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChVIIc" name="ChVII." id="ChVII.">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE KEELS OF THE NORTHLAND.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"H<span class="smcap">ow</span> we shall be crowded!" exclaimed
Ned, the son of Webb. "Who ever
supposed that the Vikings had ships that
would carry so many passengers? Some of
them, too, are loaded with horses."</p>

<p>It was about noon of the day after the great
review of Hardrada's army, and Ned was
standing upon the high prow of the <i>Serpent</i>,
the two-masted war-ship which was to transport
Vebba's men and others to the coast of
England. He knew that Tostig the Earl had
hurried away in a swift vessel, the previous
evening, to rejoin his own squadron at
Bruges, and he remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad he went. I couldn't guess what
to say if he were to corner me and ask questions."</p>

<p>Everything here was going forward in good
order, for Hardrada was an experienced seaman,
and so were his officers. They knew
thoroughly well how to manage an embarkation
of troops, and therefore there was no confusion.
The gathered warriors marched to the
shore and were embarked rapidly, thousand
after thousand. It might be an exaggeration,
but Ned had obtained an idea that the three
hundred ships of the king, sailing from this
and other ports, when joined by those of
Tostig, would be carrying over thirty thousand
men. It was also expected that upon landing
they would be reinforced by as many more of
the disaffected Saxons who were ready to
rebel against the hard rule of Harold, the son
of Godwin, who was not descended from the
English royal line.</p>

<p>"He is all the better for that," thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Ned. "I like him. He was elected, like one
of our presidents. They swore him in, too."</p>

<p>He had to confess, nevertheless, that the
appearance of things was bad for the English
king,&mdash;or president. Harold was to be,
indeed, the last ruler of England chosen by
regular election, like an American.</p>

<p>All of the ships were regarded as war-ships,
and none of them had been constructed for
ease, elegance, or the passenger business.
Each of them had more or less cabin room
for men of high degree and importance, but
the rank and file, as Ned called them, would,
obviously, have to camp out wherever they
might find deck room to lie down on. It was
quite a comfort to Ned to find that Lars and
he were to have bunks under the after deck.</p>

<p>"It will be a good deal better," he said,
"if there should come a rainy night."</p>

<p>The weather now was pleasant, and ship
after ship was made ready and sailed away.
All the while, the blowing of horns and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
shouting were tremendous, and every harper
in the fleet seemed to be twanging the best
he knew how. There were many flags and
streamers, and Ned saw several banners which
bore the black picture of a raven. He was
staring around him in all directions, and the
<i>Serpent</i> was swiftly gliding out of the harbour,
when a hearty voice at his side declared:</p>

<p>"My boy, I am glad to be with thee on
the same ship. I'll tell thee one thing. We
are on a doubtful errand. Whichever side
wins, I am intending to stay in England.
There are plenty of heathen there to convert,
and I'll not be in Norway another winter.
It's a cold place in snow time. Even the sea
freezes hard, and the wolves come howling
into the towns at night, and a man's nose
getteth frost-bitten if he weareth it out-of-doors.
They have fine winters often in England."</p>

<p>"They are not so long, either," said Ned.
"I'd rather be there, myself. How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
days dost thou give for this voyage of
ours?"</p>

<p>"That dependeth upon the wind," said
Father Brian, "and how much will come, I
don't know. These heathen pirates have
been praying for good blasts to all the old
idols they can think of. They don't seem to
know the name of one saint among them.
It's not so in Ireland. I am glad I was born
in a civilised land, among Christians. I am
told that Duke William of Normandy can
speak Latin. He is an exceedingly religious
man. He is in favour of teaching, too, but
not one man in a thousand of his own army
can read the best parchment I can put before
him."</p>

<p>Ned had already begun to find his Latin
speech improving with the constant exercise
of it forced upon him by Father Brian. Day
by day, also, he could make better use of
Erica's Norwegian, for he was continually
picking up new words. Nevertheless, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
all the while wondering what he was to do
among Saxons to keep up the impression that
he was one of them. It was almost a relief,
therefore, when, shortly, the zealous missionary
began to grumble concerning the babel
of tongues and dialects in the British Islands.</p>

<p>"It is all sorts," he said. "Where we are
to land, they are mostly Angles and Danes
and one kind of Saxons. Besides them, there
are Jutes, Frisians, West Saxons, South
Saxons, East Saxons, Scot Saxons, and no
man knoweth what else, not to speak of the
Gaels and the Welsh and the Cornishmen.
It is not at all the same in Ireland, my boy,
where all speak the same tongue, except at
the north of it and at the south and in the
middle. I can do nothing with a Briton, or a
Gael, or a Manxman, or with one of those
long-legged Kernes from the West and the
centre, that speak no tongue at all but a kind
of jabber that everybody else hath forgotten,
long ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>From his further account it appeared that
all the countries and islands of those regions
were divided among many tribes, clans, and
languages. Each leading language was split
up into local dialects which differed much in
the speaking.</p>

<p>"That's it!" thought Ned. "I can get
along well enough, where it's an every-day
matter for one fellow not to understand
another of the same kind. They'll pay it no
attention."</p>

<p>That night was a warm one, and the fleet
sailed along comfortably before a fair wind.
So it did during the next day, and the next.
The swarm of keels kept pretty well together,
and Ned, the son of Webb, of York in
Northumberland, the young friend of Tostig
the Earl, wondered more and more at the size,
the swiftness, and the good handling of those
strangely modelled war-ships. Sailing down
the North Sea appeared, thus far, as a very
agreeable summer excursion, except for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
crowded condition of the <i>Serpent</i>. That, however,
was only a temporary inconvenience,
which everybody had calculated upon beforehand,
and the men endured it with general
good humour.</p>

<p>Altogether different became the tone of
public feeling, so to call it, when a gale swept
down from the north, lashing the sea into
foaming surges. The ships of the Vikings
were constructed to stand against stormy
weather, but all the sails had to be taken in.
Then, for the first time, Ned, the son of Webb,
began to appreciate the thole-pins and the
great oars. To each of the latter, long-handled,
broad-bladed, two, or even three,
strong men were ordered. On the high deck
at the stern stood an officer, shouting loudly
in a hoarse cadence like a song, and stamping
time with his feet, that all the rowers might
pull together. At regular intervals the oarsmen
were changed, so that all on board,
except men of high rank, might take turns at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
this hard and disagreeable work. Even such
celebrated warriors as Sikend the Berserker
were called upon to do their share. Ned,
himself, was half afraid that he might be
given an oar, and he may have escaped quite
as much on account of his age and size as by
reason of his supposed aristocracy.</p>

<p>Harder and harder blew the wind as the
sun went down, and the most important consolation
was that it was all the while driving
them toward England. The night which followed
was full of discomfort. In the morning
the rain-drenched and weary Vikings were
grumbling all over the ship. It was as if King
Harold Hardrada and Tostig the Earl were to
be held responsible for not having provided
better weather and smoother water.</p>

<p>"A fine lot of men they are," scornfully
remarked Father Brian. "Look at them!
Who would have expected to see so many of
them seasick at once? I was never like that,
any time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour or so later, Ned saw his reverence
leaning dolefully over a bulwark between two
dripping war-shields, with all the roses gone
from his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he exclaimed. "What did I eat,
to-day? It's not the motion of the ship I
care for. She's a bad one to pitch and roll,
anyhow. They build better ships than this
in Ireland."</p>

<p>The great fleet had been increased from
day to day, as it was joined by squadrons
from other ports. It was necessarily scattered
far and wide by this rough weather. When,
at last, land was seen to the westward, word
was passed rapidly around, by swift rowboats,
that all should draw well together, and make
for the wide bay, known as the Humber, for
there the landing was to be made. All disaffection
among the overcrowded Vikings
instantly disappeared, as the good news spread
among them, and there was an immediate
cleaning of all weapons and armour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned himself felt better, for several reasons.</p>

<p>"I've not been so very seasick," he said to
himself, "but I'd like to eat something
cooked. I'm tired of chewing dried fish and
raw ham. The water is bad, too, and I won't
drink any beer. There's one thing, though;
there isn't any smoking or tobacco chewing
among these fellows. There isn't a pipe, nor
a cigar, nor a Virginia plug, in the whole
fleet. No cigarettes. They can't get any,
yet, but they will, some day."</p>

<p>The headlands at the mouth of the Humber
were very near now. The King of England
had no forts there, nor had he stationed any
forces to oppose the landing of an enemy.
The fact was, as Ned had learned from Father
Brian, that the Saxons did very little stone-work
building, whether of castles or churches.</p>

<p>"That's one thing they'll have to learn
after they're conquered," said the good missionary.
"The ignorant savages! But it'll
be a queer lot of teaching that'll be going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
among them now, with Tostig and Hardrada
for teachers."</p>

<p>Ned was all the more of that opinion after
he heard Sikend the Berserker blessing Thor
and Woden for getting him across the sea,
and for the chances he was soon to have
for murdering Saxons.</p>

<p>"I know what he means by the Valkyrias
and the ravens," said Ned to Father Brian,
"but what is it he was saying about being
afraid of a cow's death?"</p>

<p>"These Norse heathen," replied the priest,
"have a notion that it's a burning shame for
any man to die decently in his bed. He'd
rather be murdered, any day. May he have
his own will in that matter, say I! Most
likely he will not be disappointed, this trip,
and there will be more than one funeral the
day they put him under,&mdash;the wild beast!"</p>

<p>At that moment, truly, Sikend was hardly
looking like a human being. He sat upon
the low deck amidships, between the rows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
rowers, sharpening with a stone the edge
of an enormous battle-ax. Now and then he
would hold it up to the light, twirling its
heavy weight as if it had been a feather,
while his dark, hairy features twisted and
gleamed with bloodthirsty ferocity, and his
deeply sunken eyes flashed fire. From such
a slayer as he, no foeman might look for
mercy. It was said of all Berserkers that in
their blind rage they spared neither old nor
young, man or woman or child.</p>

<p>"All of them will have to be killed off,"
said Ned, decidedly. "The world can't be
really civilised while they are in it."</p>

<p>"That is what will have to be done," replied
Father Brian. "We had them as bad
as he is, in the old days, in Ireland. Picts
and Scots, they were, and Cornishmen that
came over to harry the land. The worst
of all were the giants, like Finn and his big
brethren. What wouldst thou think of
Sikend now, my boy, if he were twelve feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
high, and had four arms to kill with, instead
of only twain, his mouth blowing fire, and his
every stride more than the length of a tall
man?"</p>

<p>"I should go for him with a rifle, at long
range," said Ned. "Hullo! Father Brian!
There's the king's own ship, ahead of us,
going right into the Humber. We are all to
follow him, they said. That land yonder
is England!"</p>

<p>"Hurrah for that!" shouted the good
missionary. "The next ship behind Hardrada's
is Tostig's. Hark to the war-horns!
All the Vikings will be going blood wild!
Ah, my boy, there'll be hard fighting before
long. It's not one battle that'll conquer
England,&mdash;or Ireland either, for that
matter."</p>

<p>All the ships in sight were obeying their
orders to follow the king. The wind had
gone down, and they could fall into line all
the better for being propelled by oars. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Ned remarked, oars were as good as steam,
for that business, so far as they went. The
fleet made a splendid appearance, and it was
a sight worth seeing to watch so many banks
of long oars dipping and lifting together.</p>

<p>"It is a tremendous show," said Ned to
Father Brian, "but the <i>Kentucky</i> could make
it look as if there'd been a fire in half an
hour."</p>

<p>"Speak Latin," said the missionary. "What
is that thou wert saying? I don't know one
word of Saxon. It's a tongue they'll all get
rid of when they're conquered."</p>

<p>Ned made an effort to explain himself, but
it was of no use, for his friend knew nothing
about gunpowder.</p>

<p>"It's a kind of witchcraft, most likely,"
was the good man's pious conclusion. "All
of them ought to be burned, and they will be.
It's not a country like England that can be
civilised in that way. It hath been on my
mind, though, that if the Northmen and Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
William kill off the Saxons, we could send
over enough of the right kind of men from
Ireland to make a fine land of it."</p>

<p>"You could do that," replied Ned. "Loads
and loads of Irish have come over to our
country, and after they get there they all
turn into Americans."</p>

<p>"That's witchcraft," again grumbled Father
Brian. "What's the good of them if they all
become heathen themselves?"</p>

<p>Before Ned could decide exactly what to
say to that point, a loud shout came to him
from Lars.</p>

<p>"Mail and helmet, O Ned, the son of
Webb! The command of the king is that
every man shall land in full armour. There
will be a battle right away."</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" shouted Ned, and up sprang
the good missionary, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I'll be there myself! I'll not have any
heathen Saxon cut my throat for nothing,
either. I'll have good mail under my cassock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and I can swing an ax with any of them.
Get thyself ready, my boy. Thou art young
for it, but thou canst show them what thou
art made of."</p>

<p>Ned was already on his way to his bunk
under the deck to put on his battle trappings,
and he shortly discovered that the missionary
had not left Norway, or it might be Ireland,
unprovided for warlike emergencies.</p>

<p>The shields which had hung along the bulwarks
of the <i>Serpent</i> during the voyage were
now transferred to the strong left arms of their
owners. Even the rowers put on their mail.
War-horn after war-horn rang out across
the sea, chief answering chief with fierce,
defiant music, while once more came twanging
with the horn blasts the sound of many
harps. It was an hour of intense excitement,
for the armament of the Sea King had come
to decide the fate and future of a great empire.
It was well understood by all, moreover,
that it was to be met by a Saxon king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and general, Harold, the son of Godwin,
who was believed to be equal to Alfred the
Great himself, in either battle-field or council-room.
Ned had noticed that the Vikings did
not often speak of him as king, but rather by
the old title of Harold the Earl, under which
he had earned his fame.</p>

<p>As Earl of Wessex and as prime minister
of Edward the Confessor he had long been
the actual ruler of England, dreaded by its
enemies and greatly beloved by its people.</p>

<p>Ned also remembered that the West Saxons
had been Alfred's own people, his original
kingdom.</p>

<p>"It worked like a kind of hub," he said,
"and the other kingdoms of the old Heptarchy
were stuck on, one after another.
Father Brian says that some of them are
hitched on a little loosely, even now, and
that Harold cannot make them obey him any
too well. That may get him whipped in this
fight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>The Humber is a bay, long and wide, which
narrows gradually toward the place where the
river Ouse runs into it. The invading fleet
was, therefore, compelled to accommodate its
order and movement to the shape and area of
the water it was now rowing into. It soon
began to string out, with a narrower front,
and the <i>Serpent</i> was not one of the foremost
vessels.</p>

<p>"I should like to see the first of them get
ashore," said Ned to Father Brian.</p>

<p>"Thou art all too late for that," replied
the good missionary. "Our ship came right
along, with nothing else to do, but Hardrada's
men have been working havoc everywhere.
There hath been hard fighting in the Scotch
islands, that's the Orkneys and Shetland, and
a good many Scots are with him now. Didst
thou know he had ships and men from Iceland,
where the fire mountain is?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ned. "That's a long way off."</p>

<p>"So it is," continued Father Brian, "and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
they are a bit civilised up there. And while
we have sailed along, part of Hardrada's
army hath been harrying the coast of Yorkshire,
they call it, to no good that I can see.
Now he hath pulled them all together, and if
he doth not get himself killed he will conquer
the north of England first. It is on my mind
that he hath been wasting his chances. We
shall soon see about that."</p>

<p>How and where the landing was to be
made, was, indeed, a matter of great importance.
Narrower became the channel of the
Humber, and still the long line of ships rowed
steadily on. No man could say just where
the Humber ended and the Ouse began. Before
long the mouth of a river was reached on
the left. That was the Don, and Ned did not
see any ships go into it. Not a great deal
farther up, on the same side, was another
stream flowing into the Ouse, and that was
the river Aire.</p>

<p>"It's of no use to Hardrada," said Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Brian. "What he wanteth to do, now, is to
get his grip on thy own city of York, and
maybe he will."</p>

<p>A sort of gloomy doubt seemed to be growing
in the mind of the good missionary, and
he evidently had military ideas of his own.</p>

<p>"Thou mayest remember," he remarked to
Ned, "that the women at Vebba's place made
no wailing at all when their men marched
away? I am told that it was not so elsewhere.
The women wept as if they were
mourning, and all the old ones, that are half
witch-like, foretold bad luck. There hath
many a bad luck sign been spoken of. Here
we are, though."</p>

<p>So they were, and the now more swiftly
rowed ships of the Vikings were crowding
one another somewhat in the narrow
Ouse.</p>

<p>Lars came in full armour to stand by Ned,
and gaze at the woodlands, the cultivated
fields, and the homesteads on either bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
He had been almost a talkative boy in Norway,
among his hawks and hounds and the
scenery he was accustomed to. Ever since
coming on board the <i>Serpent</i>, however, he
had seemed another fellow. He was tall and
strong for his age, and his yellow hair was
put up in a long braid, which the back rim of
his steel cap appeared to rest on. His bright
gray eyes were full of excitement, but his lips
were tightly closed, as if it were impossible
for him to express something or was resolutely
keeping it in.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Lars?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Father is angry with the king," said Lars.
"The troops are to land all along shore.
That will scatter them, he saith, and some of
them will be cut to pieces by these Danes
and Angles of Northumberland. Father
doth not believe that thy Earl Tostig can
do anything with them. All the news is
bad."</p>

<p>That was the longest speech Ned had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
him make since leaving Norway, and Father
Brian at once replied to it:</p>

<p>"Thy father's a man of sense, my boy. I
am thinking I will keep myself a good piece
in the rear of this army rather than at the
front. That's where men get killed, anyhow."</p>

<p>The <i>Serpent</i> had advanced steadily, and
she was now passing the mouth of the river
Derwent, on the right. Large numbers of
vessels of all sizes, which had been ahead
of her, were already making fast at convenient
places along the banks. From each
of these gang-planks were put out, and lines
of warriors were marching forth upon the
land. From other ships, at anchor out in
the stream, boats were plying, but Father
Brian was not looking at them. He was
gazing very critically down the river.</p>

<p>"There they go," he muttered. "All those
men that are landing away down yonder,
below the mouth of the Derwent, will have
that bit of water and swamp between them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and us. They are cut off from doing
any good if the rest of us get into a battle.
Maybe it's good generalship and maybe it
isn't. I wish Hardrada were an Irishman,
and he'd never have split his army in two."</p>

<p>A very strong force of Northmen was
getting ashore with Hardrada, above the
mouth of the Derwent, nevertheless, and
among them, before long, were all the passengers
of the <i>Serpent</i>.</p>

<p>There was nobody there to oppose them.
The Earls of Northumberland and Mercia,
Edwin and Morcar, had expected Hardrada
to come, but not so soon, and they had not
dreamed that he would push right on up the
river, to land so near them. They were not
ready, therefore, and the King of Norway had
now posted his army in strong positions, while
the frightened people who had fled at his
coming were telling the news in the city of
York. The horses, what there were of them,
were also coming ashore, but it was evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that the invading army would have no cavalry
to speak of.</p>

<p>"That isn't the worst of it, by any means,"
remarked Ned, the son of Webb, as he
marched along with Vebba's men. "England
can never be conquered without artillery. If
King Harold or the Saxon earls could bring
out a few batteries of Maxim guns, or of
field-pieces like those of the Fourth Artillery,
they could tear up this invasion before
Saturday night."</p>

<p>The landing of so great an army was a
matter of time and toil, and it was well
indeed for the Vikings that there were neither
forts nor forces for them to encounter at the
outset. Even when sunset came, and after
that the darkness, ship after ship, as it
arrived, was hastily unladen, every man
stepping ashore with an idea that he might
be marching into an immediate collision with
the Saxons.</p>

<p>"It is pretty good luck we have had, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
far," said Father Brian, "in spite of the old
women of Norway, but no man ever knoweth
exactly when the luck will turn, if it's against
him and if he is careless about what he is
doing. There is always bad luck in that."</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChVIIIc" name="ChVIII." id="ChVIII.">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE SCOUTING PARTY.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">here</span> was no large town at or near the
mouth of the Humber. There were villages
along the coast, however, and the uplands
on either shore were dotted with hamlets
and cabins. There were also comfortable
farmhouses and the half-fortified residences
of the richer landholders. To all sorts of
people, the fishermen had brought in early
warning of the coming of the Norway fleet.
Time had been given for getting away and
for the removal of much property to places of
comparative safety. Therefore, every house
which the invaders had entered upon landing
had been found nearly empty, to the great
disgust of the brave Vikings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didst thou see the carts that went ashore
from the ships?" asked Father Brian of his
young friend. "The horses were fetched
along to pull them and not for riding. They
will go out to gather all that's left, or there'll
be a famine in the army."</p>

<p>"The king's orders are not to kill anybody
that isn't fighting," said Ned. "Tostig lost
his earldom by being cruel to the people.
Now he is going to try and make himself
popular."</p>

<p>"He will not do that," said Father Brian.
"They know the hard hand he put on
them. It's a pity, indeed, about the cattle
and horses, my boy. I'm afraid we will get
none. There is only one kind of cattle that
the English couldn't take with them."</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"It's the pigs," replied the good missionary.
"Not one of them could be driven easily, and
there will be fresh pork in camp. All the
big houses, too, have more or less bacon in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
them and dried fish. I will talk no more,
now. This is the place that Vebba hath
chosen for our sleeping."</p>

<p>It was an open place among trees, well on
in the advance but within the army outposts.
No tents had been provided, and once more
did Ned, the son of Webb, distinguish himself
by the miraculous rapidity with which he
kindled a camp-fire. He was likely to become
a favourite with the men, if this was to go on,
although Sikend the Berserker stared at him
gloomily, and muttered something dangerous
about killing wizards.</p>

<p>By that fire a great deal of cooking was
done that evening, even Sikend broiling his
fresh pork as if he had no prejudices.</p>

<p>"That didn't come from any of the ships,"
remarked Ned, as he saw the supplies of
butcher meat, even of beef, brought in. "I
suppose it is what army men call foraging,
and it's another name for plundering. I hope
they didn't have to kill anybody, but that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
what they want to do more than anything
else."</p>

<p>The night was pleasant, but it was long
before Ned could shut his eyes. Not that he
could see anything with them at more than a
few yards from the fires. The dull glare of
these shone upon polished shields and armour,
here and there. He could see, too, the dim
shapes of sentries and patrols, standing still
or walking to and fro. They did not often
have occasion to speak, and when they did so
it was in the gruff and guarded tones of men
on the watch for enemies.</p>

<p>The thing which, more than anything else,
seemed to keep him awake, was a continual
dull roar which filled his ears and worried
him.</p>

<p>"It isn't the roar of waves on the shore,"
he thought. "That may be part of it, but I
guess there is something more. I know now!
It is the sound of the camp! It is the roar
of the army. I remember, in New York, if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
fellow gets up before daylight and looks out
of a window it is all pretty still until he
listens. Then he will hear something like
this, a good deal like the roar of a waterfall.
Then, as the morning goes along, the racket
grows, with the carts and everything, till he
gets so used to it that he can't hear it any
longer. There are so many thousands of men
here, and I shouldn't wonder if a good many
of 'em were snoring."</p>

<p>He could rest more quietly after he understood
that mighty hum, but it was not yet
sunrise when he was awakened by a jerk of
his left elbow.</p>

<p>"Get up, my boy," said the voice of
Father Brian. "I've roused Lars. I have
something for both of you. We will eat
our breakfast at once, and then we'll be
off. I have permission from Vebba to go
out scouting among the heathen Saxons. It's
fine!"</p>

<p>"Scouting!" exclaimed Ned, springing up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and reaching for his mail. "Of all things!
I'm ready&mdash;I'm awfully hungry, too."</p>

<p>A breakfast of fresh pork broiled at the
end of a stick, and nothing to go with it but
water, may be prepared and eaten without
much waste of time. Neither Lars nor Ned
felt like making a long affair of it, but his
Reverence was the first to throw away his
broiling-stick.</p>

<p>"Come along now!" he exclaimed. "The
beasts are tethered handy. I pulled them
out of a drove that was gathered by the men.
We have bridles but no saddles, and I've
ridden that way many a time in Ireland, bless
her! Not that these Mercia ponies are at all
the equal of our Irish horses. The best in
all the world can be found among the farms
around Clontarf."</p>

<p>In a minute or so more they and a tall
Viking who was to go with them were loosening
the halters of four strong-looking but
somewhat short-legged horses. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
not properly to be called ponies, being larger
and heavier than the shelties of Scotland or
the small horses of Wales. They belonged to
a peculiar breed which was at that time very
numerous in England. Not one of them objected
to being mounted, and the four scouts
galloped away unchallenged by any sentinel.</p>

<p>"No man will hinder us," remarked Father
Brian. "I think that Tostig the Earl is wise.
He gave out that all spies might come and
go freely. He willed that the English earls
should be told what's coming to them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they will be scared very
badly," replied Ned. "Hardrada isn't going
to win in that way. Everybody knows that
the English will fight."</p>

<p>The sun was rising now, and all the camps
behind them were astir. More ships were
reaching landing-places and more troops were
coming on shore, but not by any means the
whole of Hardrada's army was as yet in shape
for a great battle. It would be well for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to advance with great prudence until his full
strength should be with him, and he was
doing so. The same kind of caution might
have been well for the Northumberland and
Mercian earls, Edwin and Morcar, but they
were even now preparing to strike without
waiting to gather sufficient forces. They had
been unready and now they were hasty.</p>

<p>The country was beautiful. It did not
seem to be densely peopled. There were
many farms, however, which seemed to Ned
to be under pretty good cultivation. Empty,
desolate, abandoned were all the dwellings
past which the scouts rode onward. There
were no cattle to be seen in the fields.</p>

<p>"There hath been no burning, as yet,"
remarked the tall Viking. "Tostig hath forbidden
fire, to the great discontent of many.
Of what good indeed is war if we are not to
burn and slay? It is but little better than
peace."</p>

<p>"O thou Leif, the son of Beo," broke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Father Brian, angrily, "if thou art in the
advance on the morrow, or the next day, I
think the heathen Saxons will show thee war
enough."</p>

<p>"Woden be praised for that!" exclaimed
the Viking. "I think they will. The Valkyrias
will come for many. I shall die no
cow's death. I would that Thor and his
hammer and all the hero gods of the North
might come and fight for King Harold of
Norway."</p>

<p>"Hear him!" muttered the good missionary.
"And men like him call themselves Christians!
I would as soon be an Englishman!"</p>

<p>"The English are not heathens," said Ned,
the son of Webb. "Alfred the Great was
the best kind of man."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Father Brian, "and a
bad lot he had to deal with. He was helped
much by the right sort of educated missionaries
from Ireland,&mdash;men, like myself, that
could read and write. I am glad, my boy, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
be here now and carry on the good work.
Hark! What's that? Ride fast, all! There
is evil ahead. Hear that shrieking of
women!"</p>

<p>A little beyond them was a sharp turn in
the narrow road they were following, and on
either side were dense woods. Forward
dashed the four horsemen, headed by the
now excited missionary, and they all drew
rein to reconnoitre the situation as soon as
they had galloped around the turn.</p>

<p>Here was a sight to see, indeed! The
land beyond, at the right, was under cultivation,
cut up into enclosures of various sizes.
There were many cabins, and out of the hamlet
composed of them led other roads. Some
distance back from the middle of the hamlet
was an ancient-looking timber-built manse or
large farmhouse, and around this was a
pretty strong stockade, bordered by a deep
ditch. This was the local fort, into which
all the near neighbours were expected to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
for safety in case of sudden peril. That they
had at the present time done so was evident,
for it was from within the stockade that the
shrieks and cries were arising.</p>

<p>"There are none of them hurt yet, I trust,"
said Father Brian. "Look at them, though!
The wolves of Norway! They are putting
fire to the stockade, to burn a hole in it.
They are swearing to slay every soul for only
shutting the gate against them."</p>

<p>"I am glad they were slow in their fire
making," said Ned. "That was flint and
steel work. It's a good thing they didn't
have any parlour matches. One cartridge of
dynamite, though, would blow that stockade
every which way&mdash;or a can of powder."</p>

<p>"Ned, the son of Webb," shouted Father
Brian, "thou art Tostig's man. The poor
folk in the fort belong to his earldom. Ride
in with me, now, and bid those Vikings that
they must obey the earl and the king!"</p>

<p>"They may listen," growled Leif, the son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Beo, "or they may slay us all for interfering.
I have split a man's head, myself,
for less than that. Ride on!"</p>

<p>Ned felt all his pulses tingling as he urged
onward his horse, for the screams of terror
were increasing, and well they might. Several
of the angry marauders assailing the
stockade were chopping at it furiously with
their battle-axes, and there was no doubt but
what they would shortly cut their way in.</p>

<p>He shouted loudly, but the Vikings did not
seem to hear or heed him, and almost before
he knew it he was at the little bridge across
the moat in front of the great gate of the
stockade. This bridge should have been removed
long since by the garrison, but for
some reason or other it had stuck fast, rendering
the ditch of small account as a defence.
Down to the ground sprang Father Brian, at
that moment, pole-ax in hand, and down
dropped Ned, while Lars and Leif, the son of
Beo, bravely followed them. Here, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
stood the four scouts, like heroes, with their
backs to the gate. This was massively made,
of oaken planks, fastened with iron spikes,
and was likely to withstand much chopping.
As yet, it appeared that no blood had been
shed on either side, but there could be no
doubt but what the Saxons or Angles, or
whatever they were, would sell their lives
dearly.</p>

<p>"The Vikings don't seem to care a straw
for anything I've said," groaned Ned. "I
don't suppose they take scalps, but they'll kill
women and children as if they were so many
Sioux Indians. I suppose the English would
be just as cruel, if they had a chance. I
wish the world were civilised."</p>

<p>"Come on, ye wolves of Norway," roared
the valiant priest, at his side. "But I bid ye
hold your hands. By the order of Harold
the King and Tostig the Earl! Ye will have
to slay us four ere ye break in to murder the
people of the earl."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>One who seemed a chief among the Vikings
paused only to blow a strong blast on his
war-horn, and then he came angrily forward
toward Brian.</p>

<p>"I know thee not," he said. "Thou art
an outlander and a saga man, but I know thy
companions. That youth is a son of my
friend Vebba, of Nordensfiord. With him is
Vebba's house-carle. The boy with a strange
tongue I know to be a lithsman of Tostig the
Earl. Were we to slay him, we were but
lost men. The orders are hard, but I will
obey them, only that we will make prize of
all casks of ale and of whatever is fit to eat.
Blood we will not shed."</p>

<p>"To that we all give assent," shouted a
man's voice from within the stockade. "Upon
that pledge we will open the gate. We belong
to Tostig the Earl, and therefore we did not
flee at his coming."</p>

<p>"We will keep faith with you," responded
the Viking leader. "Ned, the son of Webb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
hath the right in this matter. He doeth well
to protect the people of his earl. I approve
him. Open the gate!"</p>

<p>Open it swung, and those who were within
waited fearlessly, for all the Northmen could
be trusted to do no unnecessary murder after
they had plighted faith with friend or foe.</p>

<p>"Go not in," whispered Father Brian to
Ned. "The people are safer than thou art,
and there are black looks sent at thee. Thou
hast robbed wolves of their prey, and they
will bite thee if they may."</p>

<p>There came a sound of galloping hoofs
around the turn in the road, as Ned and his
friends were getting upon their horses. In a
minute more, all the open spaces of the
hamlet swarmed with armed riders, and there
arose a shout of "Tostig the Earl!"</p>

<p>Forward rode Father Brian, while Leif, the
son of Beo, restrained the others.</p>

<p>"Let him report for us," he said. "I like
not to have speech with that black-haired son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of Earl Godwin. He smiteth suddenly when
his spear is in his hand, and none may account
with him."</p>

<p>They saw the haughty and cruel earl draw
his rein, face to face with the missionary, and
all could hear the loud, clear tones of the
questions and answers which followed. Brief
enough were these, and Tostig seemed to be
in a fairly good state of mind.</p>

<p>"It is well," he said. "Ned, the son of
Webb, hath guarded his father's neighbours.
I blame him not, but let him beware how he
interfereth too much. I have many a head
to strike off in this rebellious Northumberland.
I will spare not one of those who drove me
out."</p>

<p>Well was it understood that his proud heart
was full of revenge, and that his return as a
victor would bring woe to many. At this
point, nevertheless, the squadron of horsemen
halted, drawing away from the roadside
as if waiting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have done our duty," said Father
Brian to Leif. "Had we not stayed that
slaughter, there had been sharp vengeance
taken."</p>

<p>"The men may thank the son of Webb and
thee," said Leif. "So may the Angles, for
else they were all dead ere this. There cometh
the vanguard! There will be a battle this
day."</p>

<p>"It cometh shortly," said the missionary.
"It is but nine miles from the river to the
city gates. The king will strike before
Morcar and Edwin have time to gather more
forces."</p>

<p>"We will go on with them," said Ned. "I
would not miss seeing that battle for anything.
That's what I came for."</p>

<p>"Keep well behind the foremost lines,
then," said his reverend friend. "Serve
Tostig, if thou wilt, but strike not any of
thine own people. York is thy city, and
thou wilt be back in it before many hours."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hurrah for that!" exclaimed Ned. "I
want a good look at it as it is now."</p>

<p>Thousand after thousand, the host of Hardrada
pressed forward. Other columns of the
invaders were advancing by other roads and
across the fields and through the woods.
There would be enough of them to make a
strong front at any place where the men of
Northumberland might meet them. Not with
the vanguard, but between two solid bodies
of Northern spearmen, did Ned, the son of
Webb, and his three friends push forward
toward the first great battle that was to be
fought in England by Hardrada, the Sea
King, and his terrible army.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChIXc" name="ChIX." id="ChIX.">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE GREAT FULFORD FIGHT.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> battle was at hand, and all the men
knew that they were marching into it.</p>

<p>"I'm in!" shouted Ned, the son of Webb.
"But I haven't any horn to blow. Hear 'em!
They are all going wild! Fighting is what
they live for, and they're not good for much
of anything else, to speak of."</p>

<p>No generalship whatever was exercised in
the selection of the battle-field. The lay of
the land, as Ned remarked of it, had provided
all that beforehand, and it gave no especial
advantage to either army. Nearly midway
between the river Ouse, on the left of the
Vikings, and the river Derwent, on their
right, was the moderately elevated level of
land along which they were marching. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
banks of the rivers on either side of them
were swampy.</p>

<p>It would have seemed good military policy
for the English earls to abide behind the
strong walls of York, after having missed
the opportunity to meet their enemies at the
landing. They may, however, have been
aware that a large part of Hardrada's forces
had landed below the mouth of the Derwent,
and was still on the wrong side of that river.
This, perhaps, induced them to strike a blow
at the nearer division before it should be
reinforced.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" shouted Ned, as he rode
out from a patch of wood. "See how our
lines are forming, all the way across, between
the swamps. Look yonder! Standards and
clouds of dust! The English are coming! A
host of them!"</p>

<p>"The king hath ordered us to halt, and let
them charge," replied Lars. "This is my
first battle! Hurrah!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hail to thee, O my son! Glad am I to
find thee," called out a loud voice from a
column of spearmen, catching up with them.
"Come thou and join thy father's men. Thou
shalt fight at my side this day. Let Ned, the
son of Webb, ride on and be with Tostig the
Earl, as is his duty."</p>

<p>"All right!" shouted Ned. "Go ahead,
Lars!"</p>

<p>"God keep you all this day!" earnestly
responded Father Brian. "I will keep the
boy out of harm's way, if I can. By the side
of Earl Tostig in this fight will be a place for
strong men."</p>

<p>Leif, the son of Beo, wheeled away with
Lars, and Ned shouted after them:</p>

<p>"Oh, Vebba! I am coming to join thee
and Lars as soon as we have taken
York."</p>

<p>"Maybe thou wilt and maybe thou wilt
not," growled Father Brian. "A good many
Vikings are to be killed before sunset. Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
how the Saxons come on! I am willing to
keep well away from their axes."</p>

<p>So was Ned himself, and, being on horseback,
on pretty high ground, he was able to
get a fair view of all that was going on.</p>

<p>Except for arrows and javelins, all the
fighting would be hand to hand, so that personal
skill and strength would count for all
they were worth, while the small and weak
were pretty sure to go down.</p>

<p>"There is the banner of King Hardrada,"
said Ned, "away at the left, toward the Ouse
River. I guess Tostig is with him, and I
won't go in that direction. Father Brian and
I can see more if we stay in the middle.
Whoop! Here comes the crash! It's
awful!"</p>

<p>It was the tremendous onset of the English.
It struck the Norwegian line first at
the right, and all opposition seemed to be
crushed before it. There could be no question
of the courage or prowess of the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>umberland
warriors, and their earls were
leading them well.</p>

<p>"All the saints!" exclaimed Father Brian.
"Are we to be beaten at once? Then I am
thankful that thou and I will have a chance
to ride away, for the English will spare no
man."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," replied Ned. "The king
and the earl are charging in. All their best
men are with them. See the rush of Hardrada,
with his two-handed sword. He is
like a man a-mowing! He is a giant!"</p>

<p>He had a sudden advantage given him, too,
for the English followed the routed Vikings
on the right, so that their own flank was
exposed. They were necessarily in some disorder
when the rush of the king's veterans
struck them. Even numbers were at this
point much in favour of the invaders, and
there was soon a change in the aspect of
the battle. Hard, terrible, desperate, was
that long struggle of life and death. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
slaughter thinned the ranks on both sides
fearfully.</p>

<p>More and more intense became the interest
of Ned, the son of Webb, and his companion.
Almost unconsciously they pushed forward to
get a nearer view of the combat. The contending
forces were in many places so mingled
that it was hardly possible to distinguish one
party from the other. The din was dreadful.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" suddenly exclaimed Ned. "I
declare! Father Brian's horse has run away
with him. I hope he won't be killed."</p>

<p>His own animal also grew restive, and the
next minute he was charging forward as if to
take his share in the battle.</p>

<p>"I can't hold him in!" groaned Ned,
tugging at his rein. "He is worse than
Nanny herself. There, though! The English
are breaking everywhere. It's going to
be a first-class victory for us. Oh, dear! This
fellow is taking me right along to the very
front!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>There was peril, indeed, in that. There
was no telling how far or into what the now
frantic beast might gallop on.</p>

<p>Bound after bound, neighing loudly with
fear, he dashed forward into the very thickest
of the awful carnage, while his rider stared
wildly around him upon the slayers and the
slain.</p>

<p>"Oh!" yelled Ned. "That spear struck
him! I must get off! He is falling!"</p>

<p>One of the hundreds of flying javelins had
smitten his horse in the chest, burying its
long, sharp blade almost a foot deep. Down
sank the dying victim, snorting, screaming,
and Ned sprang off only just in time to escape
from being rolled under him.</p>

<p>"I did it all the better," he remarked,
"for having no saddle or stirrups."</p>

<p>Out came his sword, but before he could do
anything with it the rush of the battle swept
on beyond him. The English were now
retreating in disorder, but the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
them were fighting as they went. Many of
them, it was afterward said, were driven into
the swamps and into the rivers, but the
stories told were probably exaggerated. At
all events, thousands of them were slain,
and the defeat of Edwin and Morcar was
decisive.</p>

<p>Ned was on foot, now, and he had marched
forward, for he did not see that he was in
any danger.</p>

<p>"They won't hold up till they get to
York," he was saying. "Just see this!"</p>

<p>He was standing at a spot where the flying
English had made a despairing rally, and all
around him were scattered scores of slain or
disabled warriors. At his very feet was a
sort of half circle of them, and he was staring
at their shattered armour when a loud cry
arose from a mailed form which had lain at
full length upon the bloody grass.</p>

<p>"One more!" it shouted. "I will strike
one more good blow against the outlanders!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Out! Out! Holy cross! Down with thee,
O wolf of Norway!"</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, had barely time
to lift his shield before his enemy was upon
him. He was nearly taken by surprise.</p>

<p>"Glad my sword was out," he said, "but
what's the use of hacking at such an iron rig
as his is? I can't hurt him. My suit is a
good one, too. Let him chop away."</p>

<p>It was on his mind that more of the dead
or wounded Saxons might get up and come
at him, however, and he felt that he was in
the worst kind of scrape. What would have
been the result if his opponent had been fresh
and unwounded was easy to calculate, for he
was a large, strong man. As it was, Ned's
greater agility and skill were enabling him to
make a particularly good fighting appearance
when something large and dark came springing
to his side.</p>

<p>"Down!" roared a terrible voice, and a
flash of steel fell cleavingly upon the helmet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the big Saxon. He dropped as if struck
by lightning, and then Ned found himself
looking up with astonishment into the fierce
face of Tostig the Earl.</p>

<p>"Art thou here?" he exclaimed. "Verily,
thou hast done well, but thou art no match
for such as he. He was one of the strongest
knaves that rebelled against me. O son of
Webb, I will remember thee well for this!"</p>

<p>Ned hardly knew what to say in reply, and
the earl's face grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Thou art of York," he said. "I bid thee
take thy first opportunity to get inside of the
walls. Learn all thou mayest, and be ready
to answer when I question thee. I would
know what is said in the city."</p>

<p>"I will get in as soon as I can," said Ned,
"but just how, I don't know."</p>

<p>Away spurred the earl, and Ned looked
after him, remarking:</p>

<p>"He is a tremendous fellow! I guess he
saved my life, and I kind o' like him. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
wonder, though, if he thinks that I killed all
of these Danes and Angles and Saxons that
are lying around here. If he does, I must
explain it to him some day. I wouldn't care
to have it look as if I told him so."</p>

<p>It was too late for any explanations at the
present time, and he was ruefully considering
what it might be best for him to try next,
when a cheerful but somewhat anxious voice
came to him from a little distance.</p>

<p>"Ned, my boy!" it exclaimed. "Art thou
there? I am glad, indeed, to find thee. Hold
on till I get to thee."</p>

<p>"Come on, Father Brian," shouted back
Ned. "Where is thy horse? Mine was killed
by a spear."</p>

<p>"The evil beast pitched me into the grass,"
responded the missionary, rapidly striding
nearer. "I will see if I can get me another
before long. I will do no walking if there is
a horse to be had. Mark thou this, though.
Hardrada hath won this battle of Fulford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
truly, but it hath cost him more men than he
can spare. If the English are going to fight
like this, the Vikings will all be killed before
the land is conquered. It is about as I
told thee it would be. They have Harold of
England to deal with, yet."</p>

<p>The battle-field was a fearful place for any
man to stroll around in. Nearly the entire
space between the two marshes was littered
with corpses. In many places the slain lay
in heaps which told of especially severe encounters,
or pitiless massacres. They were
not all Saxons, by any means, and Ned could
understand the forebodings of his intelligent
companion. Whether or not it was because
Father Brian was a highly educated man,
and could both read and write, he seemed
to be something of a general if not also of
a statesman.</p>

<p>The distance from the field to the city of
York was but a mile or so, and all that was
left of the English army was already safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
behind the walls. More had escaped, doubtless,
than the Vikings were willing to believe
or tell of, and they were in no condition for
an immediate attack upon strong fortifications.
No more of the invading forces were, as yet,
crossing the Derwent River, and the weary
victors marched on to make their camp for
the night near the margin of that stream.</p>

<p>"I guess Tostig will have enough to do
without thinking of me," said Ned to himself.
"He won't send for me, anyhow, until he
thinks I've made a trip to York and back.
What on earth could I say if he were to ask
me what street there I lived on? I was never
there in my life, and I might have to own up.
What I want most, just now, is to know
where Vebba's men are, and if Lars did any
fighting. I don't think they got to the front."</p>

<p>At this hour the King of Norway and his
officers were hard at work finding out the
state of their forces, and trying to get them
into shape for whatever might be coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
next. They were in no fear of any immediate
attack from the terribly shattered lines of the
English earls, but it would be necessary to
make short work of the subjugation of the
northern counties of England. These, as to
their boundaries and organisation, were in
effect nothing more than old kingdoms of the
Saxon Heptarchy, as changed, from time to
time, by Danish and other conquests. There
was no such thing, in those days, as a united,
solid England. Several kings were yet to
reign, and much blood was to be spilled, before
such a result as that would be accomplished.
Ned, the son of Webb, discovered, in his conversation
with Father Brian, as they walked
on among the camps, that his friend was
possessed with a curious idea that Great
Britain, for its good, must some day be
annexed to Ireland.</p>

<p>"Then, my boy," said the enthusiastic missionary,
"thou wilt see what can be done for
all these heathen by conversion and civilisa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>tion
and education. This will become almost
as fine a land to live in as Ireland itself&mdash;but
not quite."</p>

<p>They had little difficulty, after all, in discovering
the camping-place of so well known
a chief as Vebba. When it was reached there
was an exceedingly noisy welcome, with an
exchange of news items. The men liked Ned,
the son of Webb. Even Sikend the Berserker
shook hands with him, for he had heard that
the young hero from York had been seen
in the very front of the battle, doing wonders
of valour, and afterward chasing the beaten
Saxons and Danes and Angles into the swamps
of the Ouse.</p>

<p>"What a dime novel it all is!" thought Ned.
"And Vebba's men take their share of the
victory and the glory, although they were not
in it at all. Why, if it were in our army, old
Vebba might be promoted to be a brigadier,
and Sikend to be a colonel."</p>

<p>However that might be, he and Lars had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tremendous time by themselves, exchanging
yarns and experiences, and then they slept
like a pair of warlike tops.</p>

<p>The next day was Thursday, for the battle
had been fought on Wednesday. All the
army knew, at an early hour, that messengers
were coming and going between King Hardrada,
on the one side, and the English earls,
on the other. It was said that a treaty of
peace was making, and that the King of
Norway was at once to become king of all
that part of England, with Tostig under him
as Earl of Northumberland.</p>

<p>"Now, Father Brian," inquired Ned, "what
do you think of that arrangement?"</p>

<p>"What do I think of it, indeed?" replied
the subtle-minded priest. "It needeth no
thinking. It is as plain as is thy nose upon
thy face. Edwin and Morcar are doing the
thing that I would do myself, if I were in
their place. They are skirmishing to gain
time, and to put Hardrada into as deep a trap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as they can dig. Not either of them is really
intending to give up anything. Neither thou
nor I would be in a hurry to give up an earldom,
and surrender to the vengeance of Tostig
first, and then to the wrath of King Harold
of England."</p>

<p>"Thou thinkest they are playing sharp?"
said Ned. "If that is so, then all we have
to do is to watch out for a bit and we'll hear
something drop. According to your idea,
there's the biggest kind of a mistake being
made by Hardrada."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the missionary, quite
thoughtfully, "and thou and I may not
remain in the Viking camp any longer than
we can help. The command given thee by
Tostig the Earl upon the battle-field must
be obeyed by thee speedily, and I will
accompany thee into York."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ned. "We don't want
to see Tostig again until we have done
something worth while."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us now walk around," said Father
Brian. "Talk not so much in thy Saxon
tongue. I wish to see the Stamford bridge
over this swampy river Derwent. It is the
only crossing for miles and miles, up and
down. The river is not deep enough for
ships. I think it is a part of the trap set for
Hardrada."</p>

<p>"What he needs," remarked Ned, "is a
lot of East River and North River steam
ferry-boats. They would take over a whole
army before bank hours. They do it, now,
every day in the year."</p>

<p>All of the invading army that was on the
York side of the Derwent was now lying
near the head of the bridge the missionary
spoke of. On the other side of the river
was encamped very much the larger part of
the remaining strength of King Hardrada.
To this larger division additions were all the
while coming from the ships in the Humber.</p>

<p>"Here we are, my boy," said Father Brian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
as he and Ned came to the bridge. "It is a
good one, what there is of it, but it's narrow
and there is no fort at either end of it."</p>

<p>"I should say it is about wide enough for
one two-horse wagon," said Ned. "Two of
them couldn't pass each other on it. For its
length, it's about the meanest bridge I ever
saw. It would take our army a long while
to foot it across that thing."</p>

<p>"It is my opinion," said the missionary,
sombrely, "that every last man of King
Hardrada's army would do well to walk
over it this day, one way or the other, and
join forces. I have had my look at it and
I will go. It is thy duty and mine to get
into the city of York as soon as possible, and
stay there."</p>

<p>"I must get in, anyhow," said Ned. "I
wouldn't like, even now, to have the
earl come riding along and find me here.
He's rough. I think any man would want
to get behind good walls, just now, though&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>unless
he had his life insured pretty heavily
in good companies."</p>

<p>Father Brian stared at him for a moment,
but that was one of many of the sayings of
Ned, the son of Webb, to which the good man
did not attempt to make any reply.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChXc" name="ChX." id="ChX.">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE COMING OF HAROLD THE SAXON.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"S<span class="smcap">peak</span> thou in the Norway tongue, for
thou canst, that these who stand by
may understand thee. O Ned, the son of Webb,
thou wilt now find thy way into the city of
York?"</p>

<p>"That is what I am going to do, O Tostig
the Earl," responded Ned. "I can get in somehow
or other."</p>

<p>"Go thou, then, and return and tell me if
Edwin and Morcar are gathering more armed
men within the walls. Bring me what tidings
thou shalt hear concerning my brother
Harold, the King. Go, and see that thou
have a care for thy tongue, that thou bring
no news except to Harold Hardrada or
myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can keep my mouth shut," said Ned,
and away rode the stern earl, accompanied by
several Vikings of high rank, who had entered
the camp of Vebba with him.</p>

<p>Ned had been summoned to meet the earl
at a little distance from his own Norse friends,
and not even Vebba himself nor Father Brian
dared question him afterward too closely concerning
his orders from the very dangerous
tempered Tostig. As Vebba said to the missionary,
"It were a spear thrust, quickly, for
thee or me, if we foolishly meddled with
the private matters of the son of Godwin.
See that thou let the youth obey his earl."</p>

<p>"That will I do," said Father Brian, but it
evidently went hard with him.</p>

<p>Before the evening of Thursday, some results
of the peace negotiations had been made
public, and they appeared to be all that the
army ought to ask for. The city of York
was to be surrendered upon the following
Monday. There was to be no more fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
although there were yet a number of minor
points remaining to be settled.</p>

<p>Fair as this seemed, there were loud murmurs,
here and there, for many of the Vikings
were sorely disappointed. They declared that
in this manner they were being unjustly
robbed of all the pleasure upon which they
had counted in the taking and sacking of so
large and fine a town.</p>

<p>"They are as mad as wet hens," remarked
Ned, "because they are not to have the fun
of killing the people. I guess, though, that
York wouldn't be of much more use to Hardrada
and Tostig after all these pirates had
gone through it. They'd leave it worth a last
year's bird's nest."</p>

<p>Something like that was also said by Father
Brian, and all the while the prudent priest was
watching his opportunities. On Friday morning
a number of distinguished English clergymen
came out from the city in company with
the ambassadors who were to confer with Har<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>drada
and Earl Tostig. When these learned
and excellent men returned to York, the
Irish missionary and Ned, the son of Webb,
went through the gate with them.</p>

<p>"My boy," exclaimed Father Brian as
they did so, "here we are, safe and sound.
I'm sorry thy own family is not within the
walls, but thou canst do the bidding of
thy earl easily. We will find a good lodging,
and I have money enough for us both. I
found it in the pouches of some of the unfortunate
heathen that lay dead on the Fulford
field. They will not need it any more, and
it is a very timely supply for thee and me. I
will divide fairly."</p>

<p>The coins which had been gathered from
the slain at Fulford were mostly of copper
and silver, and were not very well shaped.
With these were several pieces of gold, none
of them as large as a five-dollar piece.</p>

<p>"Not any greenbacks," remarked Ned, as
he pocketed his share. "Money goes far here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
though, and a fellow earning a dollar a day is
a mogul in England in these times. Father
Brian says you can buy a horse for five dollars
and a farm for fifty. These coppers are as big
as saucepans, and one of 'em will pay for a
night's lodging at the best York hotel."</p>

<p>If he might otherwise have had some conscientious
scruples concerning the source of
this supply of money, he was willing to leave
all that to so good a man as the missionary,
and to consider the cash as the ordinary spoils
of war.</p>

<p>"I couldn't give it back to its old owners,
if I wanted to," he thought. "War is war,
anyhow, and this invasion is a great piece of
piracy from beginning to end. I am a kind
of Norse Viking pirate, myself."</p>

<p>Now that he was really inside the walls of
the city of York, he considered that he was
under a necessity for beginning to seem, if
not also to feel, exceedingly English, or rather
Danish-Saxon. Thousands of angry fugi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>tives
from the Fulford fight and thousands
more of fresh arrivals from the interior were
likely to be roaming around the streets.
Every man of them would have a weapon
with him, and was sure to have revengeful
feelings toward either a favourite of Tostig
or a young Viking.</p>

<p>"The fact is," thought Ned, "I'm a kind
of spy, and they shoot spies as soon as they
catch them. I won't do them any harm,
anyhow."</p>

<p>There was nothing in his dress or appearance
to distinguish him, for his helmet and
his mail and shield were as like as two peas
to such as were worn or carried by the English
soldiery.</p>

<p>"All the hotels will be crowded," he said
to Father Brian. "I shouldn't wonder if we
had to sleep in one of the streets."</p>

<p>"No, we will not," replied his friend. "I
have a direction to a hostelry. It is a place
of entertainment for man and beast that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
attached to one of the churches. It is likely
to be quiet and is good enough if a man can
get nothing better."</p>

<p>"Any kind of coop will do for me," said
Ned. "I'm not half so particular about that
as I am about getting under cover. I want
to see all there is of this town, too."</p>

<p>"That is thy duty," said the missionary,
"and thou wilt see but little of me before
Sunday. I have to pay my respects to the
bishop, as thou knowest."</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, did not really know
anything whatever about the manner in which
things were managed in the Northumberland
churches, but he was quite willing to do his
sightseeing or his business for Tostig by himself.
His friend led the way to the hostelry
and left him there, and as yet neither of
them had been spoken to by anybody.</p>

<p>"Well!" remarked Ned to himself, shortly
afterward, sitting by a small table with very
good mutton chops before him. "So this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
a tavern in York! I declare! When I came
through the front door of it, I thought it
looked more like a jail. Quiet kind of place
where ministers come, like Father Brian and
his friends? Those fellows at the other table
are awfully quiet&mdash;only I don't understand
a word of their jangle. There come their
swords! It's a fight!"</p>

<p>The dining-room was large, with a wooden
floor and tolerably good plain furniture. The
plates and cups were clean, and most of them
were of heavy pewter ware. Even napkins of
linen were supplied; but he had not yet seen
a yard of cotton goods. Of course there were
several tables, and around one of these had
been sitting half a dozen rough-looking men.
None was in mail, but two wore steel corselets.
The others had large round shields or targets,
and all were provided with swords. They
had talked loudly, rudely, from the moment
that they sat down, and it seemed that they
were angrily discussing the battle and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
treaty with the King of Norway. Louder,
fiercer grew their hot dispute, until one of
them struck another a blow with his fist, and
all sprang to their feet, every man drawing
his sword as he did so. The two who had
quarrelled were target men, and in a moment
more there was a ringing of steel upon blades
and bucklers. Nobody made any attempt at
interference, even the tavern waiters looking
on almost unexcitedly, as if at a common,
every-day incident. Several persons lounged
in from other rooms, and the faces of women
peered through open doorways.</p>

<p>"Why don't they call for the police?"
exclaimed Ned, without getting up. "They
ought to be sent to the station-house. I'll
finish my chops, anyhow, for I guess I'm
safe away in this corner of the room."</p>

<p>His keen hunger helped his wisdom, and he
ate very fast, becoming conscious as he did so
that there were inquiring eyes aimed at
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Both of the combatants were evidently
experienced swordsmen, and as yet all the
fight had been mere rattle, when a third target
bearer swaggered over toward Ned, saying
something to him in a tongue which
might be almost any kind of old English.</p>

<p>"He means mischief," thought Ned. "I'd
better be ready for him. I won't let him
stick me for nothing."</p>

<p>He did not say a word aloud, but in an
instant he was on his feet, shield on arm,
blade in hand. He was really but just in
time, for his sudden movement had been
taken for a challenge, and the ruffian struck
at once. The first pair paused in their
sword-play, as if they had had brawl enough,
or rather as if they were more deeply interested
in this unexpected skirmish with an
entire stranger.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Ned, loudly, as they came
closer around him, "the fellow can't fence!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>I punched him through the sword arm as if
he had been made of putty."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a href="#hec" id="he">
<img class="border" src="images/image10.jpg" width="375" height="522" alt="&quot;HE WAS REALLY BUT JUST IN TIME, FOR THE
RUFFIAN STRUCK AT ONCE.&quot;" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">"HE WAS REALLY BUT JUST IN TIME, FOR THE
RUFFIAN STRUCK AT ONCE."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>His burly antagonist had indeed been disabled
at the third pass, for he had been accustomed
to parry almost altogether with
his buckler, and modern science was against
him. He dropped his heavy broadsword and
stared at Ned in astonishment, while all the
lookers-on clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"It won't do to talk Norway here," thought
Ned. "I'll just bother them with New York
English instead of anything there is in old
York."</p>

<p>So he did, as man after man, even his assailant,
came forward to compliment him on his
prowess. He might have felt better, perhaps,
if he had understood an explanation made by
one of them to the others.</p>

<p>"The youth cometh from Cornwall," he
told them. "I have often heard their speech,
which none may understand. He belongeth
to Harold the Earl, the king. All the Cor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>nishmen
have those tricks with a blade. He
hath earned his peace. Do ye all let him
alone, for the king's sake."</p>

<p>Ned followed with some severe remarks
about good manners to strangers, the police
court, and the state prison, and they all
swaggered out of the tavern, declaring that
they had had good sport for the day, and
that they thought well of King Harold's
Cornish fighters.</p>

<p>The keeper of the inn came to have a look
at Ned, and was easily made to understand
that the next thing required by the Cornish
gladiator was another mutton chop, somewhat
less rare if possible. Ned's added request for
a cup of coffee and some custard pie was not so
perfectly comprehended, for none came. He
felt a great deal better after dinner, although
he did not so much as imagine what new
country he had now been born in or how very
much improved was his social position so far
as that hotel was concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>He was duly conducted to the room assigned
him, and it was in some respects the best he
had had since leaving the United States of
America. It was, indeed, as he declared
of it, a narrow bit of crib, with slits in the
wall for windows, but he was pleased to find
that it contained a bowl and pitcher of water,
and a couple of good towels. Even the bed
was not a bunk, but stood upon legs and had
a straw mattress, sheets, and a hair pillow.
This was luxury.</p>

<p>"It's more than I ever saw in Norway,"
he remarked. "There isn't any elevator in
this building, though, and I don't believe
there is a box of blacking in England. I
sha'n't hear any fellow calling after me to let
him shine 'em up."</p>

<p>The remainder of that day and all of Saturday
went by like a dream, so busy was Ned
with his spying into the affairs of York.
He knew that he was in one of the old historic
cities of England. Here had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
town of the ancient Britons, and the Romans,
when they conquered them, had made a prosperous
place of it. There were Roman walls
and houses yet, and all the wider streets, as
Ned said of them, "kind o' talked Latin."</p>

<p>The Saxons, when they came, had slaughtered
the Roman-British population in accordance
with the existing laws of war. All the
streets of their making, with some that were
older, were narrow as well as dirty.</p>

<p>"They are dusty enough, too, just now,"
remarked Ned. "I guess there isn't much of
a street-cleaning department in the city government.
No street sprinkling. Not a sidewalk
anywhere, nor any street lamps nor telegraph
poles. Every fellow plays policeman for himself.
If he isn't of the kind they allow to wear
a sword, he carries a big club and has a long
sheath-knife in his belt. About these days all
the women seem to be keeping indoors&mdash;without
any pianos or stationary washtubs
or sewing-machines."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw several fine churches and palaces,
but the latter and all of the larger dwellings
were like so many private forts, expecting to
be besieged and defended sometime or other.</p>

<p>"This is a queer way to live," he thought,
"with a half-grown-up war around you all
the while. I've looked at the walls, too.
They'd stand anything but artillery. I guess
a few of our heavy shells would send all that
stonework flying."</p>

<p>On Sunday morning Father Brian appeared
again at the tavern as he had promised to do.
He seemed in good spirits, but he wore a
mysterious air, as if he were prudently concealing
something. He inquired with friendly
interest concerning all of Ned's explorations
around York.</p>

<p>"My boy," he then remarked, "thou wilt
be able to make a good report to Tostig the
Earl when he cometh into the city, but I will
not permit thee to make it until then. I will
tell thee one thing more, if it will keep thee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
quiet. The Saxon guards at the Derwent
side gates would split thy head for thee if
thou shouldst attempt to go out of the trap
that hath been set for Hardrada."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be split," replied Ned,
"but what is the trap? Hardrada's army is
to march in before sunset to-morrow. I can
see the earl then."</p>

<p>"If he getteth in, my boy," laughed the
knowing missionary. "That is the trap.
Keep thy mouth shut and save thy head from
a pole-ax. They would cleave thee to the
jaws for a word. Edwin and Morcar have
saved all the time that was needed for their
plan to work. They were to give King Hardrada
a hundred and fifty important men for
hostages, and not a soul of them will ever
need to leave his house. The Norway army
will begin Monday with eating and drinking
and getting ready to put a garrison into York,
but when they come to try that they will find
out what the trap is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dost thou know it?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I am not a blind one," replied the twinkling-eyed
man from Ireland. "When I saw
Edwin and Morcar skirmishing for every hour
of time, I hardly needed to be told the rest of
it. Mark thou this, my boy, for thy life!
Thou and I belong to Harold the Earl, the
King of England, unless thou shalt see the
raven flags of Hardrada inside the walls of
York. It will be long before thou doest that,
I think."</p>

<p>The King of Norway was apparently in no
doubt whatever concerning the entire good
faith of the two English earls. He considered
them already his own subjects. Many of the
great men of Northumberland had held a
mass convention, and had voted to accept him
as their ruler. Everything was working well,
therefore, and he felt sure that his new kingdom
had been at least half won for him by
his great victory at Fulford.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, according to agreement, Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
warriors were as yet keeping stern guard at
all the gates of York.</p>

<p>"I saw them," said Ned to himself. "I
won't run against their spears, either. One
of 'em would go right through me. I'll find
just a little more, though, and then I'll get
out, if I have to climb over the walls. I
don't see any trap, if Father Brian does, but
if there is one, I'm going to warn Tostig. I
wonder if he suspects anything? Maybe
that's the reason why he sent me in."</p>

<p>Without ever having been sworn in, as he
called it, for a regular soldier of the King of
Norway, he considered himself a part of the
invading army, and he meant to do his duty
by his general so far as he could. This was,
therefore, a time of intense excitement for
him as well as for others, and when Monday
morning came he and his reverend friend
were up and out early.</p>

<p>"Come on, my boy," said Father Brian.
"If thou wilt go with me to the other side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the city, where the bridge over the Ouse
letteth in the southern highway through the
wall gate, I may be able to show thee that
which it would be worth the while of Tostig
thine earl to know."</p>

<p>"That's what I want," exclaimed Ned.
"I'll get it to him, somehow. We'll take
the trolley-cars&mdash;" There he stopped short,
for his friend was striding away.</p>

<p>Ned followed him, and he was beginning to
be aware of a new and strange idea which
made him tingle all over. He felt desperate,
warlike, and he changed his shield from over
his shoulder to its fighting-place upon his left
arm, while he gripped his spear tightly as if
he expected to use it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his appearance of angry
excitement which got him into his next bad
scrape, for other men also were in a dangerous
state of mind. The Ouse gate had been
almost reached, and Father Brian was several
paces in advance. Just here, however, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sharp turn of the winding, alley-like street,
they came unexpectedly upon a furious mob
of the lowest kind of Danes and Angles.
They were club and knife men, of course,
wearing no armour. They were nothing
more than so many fierce, wild, ignorant, and
cruel savages.</p>

<p>"Upon him! Upon him!" they yelled, at
once, in their own dialect. "He looketh like
a Norwegian! Down with him! Club him
to the death!"</p>

<p>That they might have done quickly, but for
Ned's helmet and shield and the lively use he
made of his spear. They were many, however,
and it was well for him that he could back
against a house wall so that they could not
get behind him.</p>

<p>"This is awful!" he exclaimed. "I guess
I'm done for. I prodded that fellow. I wish
I had Lars here and a dozen Vikings, or
Sikend the Berserker."</p>

<p>They were far away, indeed, but at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
moment he heard a ringing Irish war-cry.
Then, as he desperately plied his spear and
shielded his head from clubs as best he might,
he saw the long-handled pole-ax of Father
Brian flashing swiftly, murderously, upon the
shaggy crowns and shoulders of his brutal,
barbarous assailants.</p>

<p>Down they were going, like so many human
ninepins, when a great, tumultuous shouting
arose in the direction of the gate. Ned did
not get its meaning, but all the ruffians who
were still upon their feet shouted as if in reply
to it and sprang away.</p>

<p>"Thou hast fought well, my boy," said the
missionary. "Art thou hurt?"</p>

<p>"I'm banged pretty well," said Ned, "but
what is all that shouting?"</p>

<p>"Come thou along in haste," said his friend,
"I will show thee what it is. The city of
York will close no gate against the man that
is coming now. He bringeth woe to all the
host of Hardrada, and I think thou wilt de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>liver
no report to Tostig the Earl this day.
On! On to the gate!"</p>

<p>"If it is anything worth while I'll see that
the earl gets it," replied Ned, "but my shield
hath had all the style clubbed out of it. Oh,
how my arm aches&mdash;and my head!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChXIc" name="ChXI." id="ChXI.">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE BATTLE OF STAMFORD BRIDGE.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"L<span class="smcap">ook</span> thou yonder! Look, O Ned, the
son of Webb!" exclaimed Father Brian.</p>

<p>"Banners!" responded Ned, almost breathlessly.
"Horsemen! Who can they be? Is
it the army of Harold, the King of England?
Tostig and Hardrada think he is away at the
southern shore, watching for Duke William
of Normandy. Why, he can march right
on into the city!"</p>

<p>"He will do more than that," replied the
Irishman, with a very knowing look. "My
boy, mark thou well now! Not a horn nor a
trumpet soundeth among yonder horsemen,
and they ride rapidly. Stand still here and
keep thine eyes open. We are safe at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
place. Then will we go on with them, and I
think we shall see the springing of the great
trap of Harold, with which he hath caught
the Vikings."</p>

<p>"I ought to go ahead at once and warn
Tostig the Earl!" said Ned.</p>

<p>"If thou in thy armour art able to go faster
than will the horsemen of the King of England,"
half laughed the missionary, "thou
mayst be sure, also, that thousands of swords
are on guard along the walls, watching well
that no man shall get out on the Derwent
side to carry news of this thing."</p>

<p>"I'll get the news correctly, first, and then
I'll see what I can do with it," said Ned,
stubbornly, but he instantly became absorbed
by his inspection of the arriving host of the
Saxon king.</p>

<p>Right onward rode fast its vanguard of
mounted men, and Ned quickly perceived
that these were unlike anything that he had
seen before. Their arms and armour were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
nearly of a pattern that it was as if they were
in steel uniform. Their horses were large
and strong, and there was no disorder to be
seen in their trained and disciplined movements.
Minutes passed by, and then he heard
a man who stood near him exclaim, loudly:</p>

<p>"Yea, my friend, these are the thingmen.
They are the house-carles of the king. There
are no other men like them. They are the
picked ax-men of all England."</p>

<p>Already, Ned had heard a great deal about
these fighters. First among the Kings of
England, it was said, Harold had organised
and maintained a considerable standing army,
selecting for it the best men he could find,
and making them personally devoted to himself.</p>

<p>"None of Hardrada's troops march as these
do," thought Ned, as a column of house-carles
on foot followed the foremost detachment of
cavalry. "Our best city regiments can't beat
it. None of our militia would care to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
so much iron, though. Not in hot weather.
What tremendously big fellows they are.
Hullo! There comes the king! Hurrah!
I always wanted to see Harold. Isn't he
splendid! He isn't as tall as Hardrada of
Norway. He's a giant."</p>

<p>His sudden explosion of enthusiasm was
joined in by all around, and it won for him
many kindly looks and sayings, for the people
of York were going wild with joy at their
unexpected deliverance from the Vikings and
from the cruel revenges of Earl Tostig. They
could hardly believe their ears and eyes that
this was, indeed, their hero monarch.</p>

<p>Splendid, indeed, was Harold, the son of
Godwin, riding bareheaded into the city,
which might be called one of the two capitals
of his kingdom. London was the other
capital, and in many respects it was the
more important, but all the north of the
kingdom was to be ruled, in a manner, from
York.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The handsome, thoughtful face of Harold
was somewhat pallid from recent illness, but
he seemed to Ned, the son of Webb, one of
the most powerfully built men that he had
ever seen, even in Norway.</p>

<p>"They say," he was thinking, "that not
many men living can stand before him in
single fight. I shouldn't wonder if my conquest
of England is going to be cracked to
pieces, right away. If that's so, I'm going
to be one of Harold's men and fight Duke
William. Harold is a better man than Tostig.
But what on earth am I going to do about
Lars and Vebba?"</p>

<p>He was afraid that Father Brian was right,
and that he had now no chance for returning
to them or to the earl, and a strange wave of
new feeling was sweeping through him. He
did not now wish to fight these Englishmen
who were defending their country, and a
great admiration for Harold the hero was
taking possession of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Great men often seem to have a magnetic
power for drawing all other men to them, and
the last of the Saxon kings was a very strong
magnet. At his side now rode his brother,
Leofwine, not so tall, but reputed to be
almost as good a warrior. On behind them
poured steadily the long columns of the
Saxon army. Not by any means all of its
forces, however, were as thoroughly disciplined
and equipped as were the house-carles
of the king.</p>

<p>"I think thou canst now understand this
matter, my boy," remarked Father Brian.
"Thou seest with thine own eyes that all
things were ready for their coming, and that
they march through the city without halting
for a moment. None will hinder their going
out at the Derwent gate, and not a man
beyond the wall on that side knoweth of their
coming. This will be a bad day for all of
Hardrada's men that are on this side of the
Derwent. They will be surprised and out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>numbered,
and small mercy will be shown to
them."</p>

<p>"Come on!" exclaimed Ned. "I want to
get there. I may do something yet."</p>

<p>Around by other streets, necessarily much
more slowly than the mounted men, the two
friends made their way across the city. When
at last they reached the Derwent gate, however,
there was nothing to prevent their
marching out at once with the foot-soldiers
of King Harold.</p>

<p>"Father Brian," inquired Ned, "dost thou
suppose that Edwin and Morcar knew of this
all the while?"</p>

<p>"They did," he responded. "A swift messenger
came to tell them how much time they
must save in their bargainings. He was a
Saxon priest, and no man suspected his errand.
Push on, now. Some of Hardrada's
troops were expecting to march in and garrison
the city at this hour. Then the King of
Norway and Earl Tostig were to hold a court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
here and give a great feast. Very little more
good eating are they likely to do, this day."</p>

<p>The Saxon army pressed forward steadily,
and its several divisions were evidently under
clear instructions; for, as they marched, they
spread out on the right and left into a compact
battle-array, with a broad front, the centre
of which consisted of the house-carles.</p>

<p>Hardly had the foremost lines advanced
half-way from the city walls to the river Derwent
when they were suddenly confronted by
the strong body of Vikings which had been
sent to take possession of York in accordance
with the terms of surrender. It was swinging
along fearlessly, joyously, without any
thought of meeting a hostile force.</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, and his companion
had walked their very best to keep with the
advance, and they were now away at the right
of the Saxon army front, for there was no
possibility of getting through it.</p>

<p>"Hark!" suddenly exclaimed Father Brian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
"The trumpets of the house-carles! They are
sounding the charge! Hearest thou not also
that braying of Viking war-horns? Forward,
over this ridge, my boy. Thou and I are to
see something now."</p>

<p>"There they go!" shouted Ned. "The
whole line is making a rush. Quick! I want
to see that charge. I wish I knew where
Lars is. I hope he's beyond the river."</p>

<p>They were only just in time to see. The
warriors of Norway had no time at all given
them to form in order of battle. The narrow
front of their astonished column was instantly
shattered by the charge of the mounted house-carles.
Behind these, closing around upon
their flanks, clashed forward the Saxon footmen
with ax and spear.</p>

<p>Hardrada's men were veterans, and they
fell back, fighting furiously and struggling
to keep their ranks.</p>

<p>All things were against them, however,&mdash;the
surprise, the superior numbers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
flanking, encircling tactics of King Harold's
men.</p>

<p>"Look!" said Father Brian. "All this
part of them are in the trap. All that are
behind are turning toward the bridge. Only
such as reach it while these are fighting will
ever get away. The rest must die."</p>

<p>"It's as awful as the Fulford fight," said
Ned. "Hardrada lost men enough there, and
now another large slice of his army is gone.
He will have to give up the idea of conquering
England."</p>

<p>"He lost that at Fulford," said the missionary,
"and he threw away all that was
left him when he let the earls cheat him into
waiting for Harold."</p>

<p>The slaughter now going on was pitiless.
Much the larger part of Hardrada's remaining
strength, nevertheless, was still upon the
other side of the Derwent, and considerable
numbers were escaping across the bridge to
join it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is our time to go ahead, my boy," said
Father Brian. "We must get to the bank of
the river, if we can. I want to see how the
Saxons will manage to cross the bridge. Hardrada
can easily hold it against them."</p>

<p>"We can't cross it ourselves," replied Ned.
"So far as I can see, we must stay with the
English army, whether we like it or not."</p>

<p>"Thou hast no errand, now, for Tostig the
Earl," growled the missionary. "He hath no
more need for anything that thou couldst tell
him. Ho! Boats! Two of them. One will
do for us, and that is what I was looking for.
We need no bridge."</p>

<p>"There's a fellow getting into one of them,"
said Ned. "We'll take the other."</p>

<p>Down they went, and in a minute more
they were pulling away over the Derwent,
taking little notice of the occupant of the
other boat, except to see that he was a heavily
armoured spearman of the house-carles.</p>

<p>Their eyes were too busy to care for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for they were watching the rush of the fugitives
across the bridge. For life, for life, they
were crowding along the narrow passage which
was their only escape from the steel of the
Saxons. It was beginning to look as if all
who could escape were already over, when
Ned, the son of Webb, almost yelled out:</p>

<p>"Sikend! Sikend the Berserker! Look
at him! He is holding the bridge all alone.
Row on! I want to get nearer!"</p>

<p>A few strokes of the oars carried them upstream
to within fifty yards of the spot where
the Berserker stood. Clad still in full armour,
his tremendous form seeming broader and
more powerful than ever, mad with all the
battle fury of his race and nature, ax in hand
and shield on arm, he defied the rush of his
antagonists with a prowess that appeared to
be more than human.</p>

<p>Loudly and mockingly laughed the fierce
champion of Norway as he caught spear after
spear and arrow after arrow upon his broad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
bright shield. Louder yet was his shout of
vindictive triumph as his resistless ax cleft
helmet after helmet and shoulder after
shoulder. There he must die, and this he
knew right well, but his was to be no cow's
death. Little did he care for its coming,
so that he might slay many foemen, and
fall surrounded by their dead bodies.</p>

<p>Brave as they were, the Saxons fell back
for a moment from before this awful shape.
It had happened that the first of them to
cross the bridge were not of the thingmen
of Harold.</p>

<p>These were still busily destroying the remainder
of the Vikings on the York side of
the river. Again a rush was made, and
again Sikend drove it back. It was afterward
said that not less than forty warriors
fell dead under the terrible blows of the
Berserker.</p>

<p>"Yonder is King Harold, on the bank,"
said Ned, the son of Webb, "but look at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Saxon in the boat under the bridge! He is
after Sikend! He is stabbing upward with
his spear, through the cracks between the
planks!"</p>

<p>"They can't be wide enough," said Father
Brian. "Ha! Sikend is hurt! He is down
upon one knee! He can stand and fight no
longer!"</p>

<p>"I'll stop that man!" shouted Ned, pulling
hard upon his oars. "Sikend is a friend of
mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let thou alone!" exclaimed Father Brian.
"It is no affair of thine!"</p>

<p>He was too late, for Ned had now arisen,
in his sudden excitement, and his angry yell
had drawn upon him the attention of the
house-carle. Louder was the response of
the tall Saxon, and as he shouted he hurled
at Ned the long javelin with which he had
smitten the Berserker.</p>

<p>"Thou hast it!" gasped the missionary.</p>

<p>"On my shield," said Ned. "It went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
through it as if it had been cardboard, but
my mail stopped it. There! He is over!
I need not spear him!"</p>

<p>"Praise the saints!" muttered Father
Brian. "He hath upset! But for me thou
wouldst have done the same."</p>

<p>That was not strictly correct. The Saxon's
boat was floating well, but the very energy
of his furiously angry spear-throwing had
tipped his tiny punt and sent it out from
under him, plunging him into the swiftly
eddying current of the Derwent.</p>

<p>"Can he swim," whispered Ned, "with all
his armour on?"</p>

<p>"That is the last of him!" remarked
Father Brian. "He will throw no more
javelins. He is gone!"</p>

<p>Not even once did the overweighted house-carle
come to the surface. He may indeed
have been no swimmer. In the meantime,
however, with wild hurrahs, the Saxons on
the bridge had charged forward, and thrust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
after thrust had been given to the prostrate
body of the wounded Berserker. He had
fallen as he had wished to fall, a hero defying
a whole army.</p>

<p>"King Harold's men are pushing across the
bridge," said Ned, as his boat drifted out from
under it. "Why on earth did the Vikings
leave it to be defended by one man?"</p>

<p>"It is only one more of Hardrada's blunders,"
replied the missionary. "He is only
a sea king, and not a good general on the
land. A man may be the biggest pirate in
all the world and not know enough to handle
an army. He hath done little more than to
fight hard and to blunder all the while, ever
since he landed. Seest thou now? The
mounted house-carles gallop forward. Behind
them the Saxon army will form on the
other bank, and then Hardrada's army is
doomed. Thou and I will cross quickly, that
we may obtain a good place from which to
watch the shutting of this death-trap."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Vikings that are left will be awfully
outnumbered," said Ned. "Oh, how I wish I
could do something for Lars and Vebba and
our men!"</p>

<p>"The invading host hath no hope," said
his friend. "They are to be struck by one of
the best generals in the world, leading the best
fighters. Thou canst do nothing at all for thy
friends."</p>

<p>"It's too bad!" groaned Ned. "I like
Lars."</p>

<p>The boat was soon left behind them. Not
a great while afterward they were standing
upon a moderate elevation of rocky ground, at
the right of the level upon which the Saxon
forces were rapidly forming in order of battle,
under the eyes of their king. They were
doing so at this precise place, for the reason
that immediately in front of them were assembled
all that was now left of the forces of
King Hardrada.</p>

<p>"My boy," exclaimed the missionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
"both sides are looking splendidly. I am
glad to be where I can see, but any man running
in between those two fronts would be
like a corn of wheat between millstones. See
thou! All of the house-carles are dismounting.
They will fight on foot. They do not
mean to lose too many horses. I would not,
if I were they, with mayhap a long ride near
to come."</p>

<p>"William of Normandy's horses wear armour,"
said Ned. "I have seen pictures of
them,&mdash;as much armour as a man weareth."</p>

<p>"Not many of them," replied Father Brian.
"Here and there one, perhaps, if the owner
of the horse can afford that kind of harness.
Not many can, for armour costeth money. The
man that made the pictures may have had
some of that armour in his head."</p>

<p>"Thou meanest in his eye," said Ned.
"There were loads of it, anyhow, and if a
horse loaded like that were to stumble and
fall, he'd be likely to stay down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any man that goeth down to-day will
stay down," responded the missionary. "The
Northumberland levies that follow in the rear
have come to take revenge for the slaughter
at Fulford. It is a cruel, heathenish business,
from first to last. I will be glad when the
whole world shall be civilised, as it is around
Clontarf."</p>

<p>The great invasion of England by the sea
king was already a complete failure. He and
his brave but now dispirited Vikings had
rallied to make their last stand against the
unexpected and now overwhelming host of
the hero King of England. Upon that very
day, Hardrada of Norway and Tostig the
Earl were to have entered York as conquerors.
Here they were, instead, at a little after midday,
confronting sure ruin and probable death.</p>

<p>All the remaining fighting strength of York
and its vicinity had zealously joined King
Harold, so that all the while the Stamford
bridge was still thronged with marching men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
The marvel that Tostig or Hardrada had not
ordered it to be burnt or chopped away was
on the tongues of many. They may have
vainly thought of again using it to recross
the Derwent, and, if so, this was one more bad
blunder, for they had left it in the hands of
King Harold, and he was a general.</p>

<p>The army front presented by the Northmen
was exceedingly dangerous looking, nevertheless.
They had formed in close order with
the raven standard, the Land Waster, near
the centre. In front of this, at first, were the
sea king, himself, and Tostig the Earl, but
their duty as leaders shortly called upon them
to ride to and fro among their half-disheartened
followers, uttering loud sounding words of
encouragement and hope. Norwegians were
very brave men, and they responded with loud
shouts and the braying of thousands of war-horns,
while every harp among them sounded.</p>

<p>There was yet a wide open space between
the two army fronts. Into this rode out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
that of the Northmen a herald sounding a
parley. The agreement for one being made
at once, from the same side rode out Tostig
the Earl, accompanied by Vikings of rank,
and he was met about half-way by a similar
party of Saxons.</p>

<p>"What terms," asked Tostig, "will Harold
of England offer, if Harold Hardrada and
Tostig, the son of Godwin, will now make
peace with him? What will he offer to the
earl, and what part of England will he surrender
to the King of Norway?"</p>

<p>A loud, ringing voice from among the Saxon
horsemen at once responded:</p>

<p>"To Tostig, the son of Godwin, full pardon
and an earldom. To Harold Hardrada of Norway,
seven feet of English ground for his
burial. Or, since he is said to be taller
than other men, he will be allowed twelve
inches more."</p>

<p>"Then tell thou him," replied the earl,
"that Tostig will not desert the comrades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
who have trusted him, and that he will fight
to the last."</p>

<p>Back rode both of the embassies to their
own friends, and Hardrada, who had heard
all of the loudly uttered questions and answers,
exclaimed to Tostig:</p>

<p>"Good was thy speech, my friend; but
who was the man who heard and answered
thee?"</p>

<p>"He was Harold, the son of Godwin,"
replied the earl.</p>

<p>"What?" shouted the angry king. "Then
he should never have gotten back in safety to
his own!"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Tostig, sadly. "I have
erred much, but my royal brother I might
not betray to thee and thine."</p>

<p>Other things were said on both sides, but
none of them was heard by Ned, the son of
Webb. It was indeed no time for any quarrel
between Tostig and Hardrada, for the
war-horns were sounding and the Saxons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
were advancing along their whole line.
Firmly, steadily, with desperate courage and
magnificent prowess, they were met by the
close array of the Northmen.</p>

<p>Although these were not so well disciplined,
and were inferior in numbers, they were, individually,
equally skilled in arms, and they
were fighting for their lives. They fought on
with almost an appearance of possible success
until the resistless pressure of the trained
thingmen broke their front and disordered
them. Even then they would not yield, and
all who afterward told stories of the battle
had wonderful things to relate concerning the
feats of arms performed by the sea king himself,
and by Tostig the Earl, and by many of
the heroes of the Vikings.</p>

<p>Under the Land Waster standard at last an
arrow slew the King of Norway. There, also,
fighting valiantly, fell Tostig the Earl, and
with their slaying the battle ended, for the
remaining Northmen lost heart and fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, to the surprise of some, Harold the
King forbade further following, and commanded
that his forces should once more
come into close order. It may be that he
was not quite assured as to how many Vikings
might yet remain, at the shore or on the
ships. At all events, there were excellent
reasons why he should be willing to waste
neither men nor time at that place, and why
he should offer generous terms to the remnant
of the invaders. That he intended doing
this was to be made known somewhat later,
and now he sat upon his horse, not far from
the raven standard, giving directions concerning
the bodies of his brother Tostig and
of King Hardrada.</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, was not a great
many yards away, for he and the missionary
had followed the charge of the Saxons and
had been almost in the front of the battle.
He was now staring around him at the gory
evidences of how hard the fight had been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Almost at his feet lay a heap of slain Norwegians,
and from under one edge of it somebody
appeared to be struggling out.</p>

<p>"Lars, the son of Vebba!" shouted Ned.
"Come here, Father Brian. Thou and I must
save him! Get up, Lars!"</p>

<p>"No man will harm him now," shouted
back the priest. "Is he badly wounded?"</p>

<p>"I have not a cut," responded Lars himself.
"I was knocked down by a mace,
that is all, and these others fell upon me.
O Ned, the son of Webb! We are ruined!
Ruined! There will be sad mourning among
the fiords of Norway!"</p>

<p>"Vebba!" exclaimed Ned. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I saw him escape to the ships among the
first," replied Lars, almost weeping.</p>

<p>"Go thou after him, thyself," said Ned.
"Harold the King hath commanded that all
like thee may go. Tell Vebba that I am to
stay here. Run if thou canst! Get on board
a ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou art right to stay," said Lars.
"This is thine own country. Thou hast
lost thine Earl Tostig, but mind not that
too much. There are always plenty of
earls."</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" said Ned, and in a moment
more Lars was walking away briskly.</p>

<p>He was safe from spear or blade, for the
commands of Harold the King would surely
be obeyed by all his men.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChXIIc" name="ChXII." id="ChXII.">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">A RIDE IN OLD ENGLAND.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">N<span class="smcap">ed</span>, the son of Webb, stood still, gazing
very earnestly at the King of England.</p>

<p>"I suppose he feels badly about his brother,"
Ned was thinking. "I would, no matter what
he'd been up to. I'm sorry Tostig was killed,
anyhow. He was a friend of mine. I didn't
see King Harold do any hand to hand fighting,
either. I guess he kept back on purpose."</p>

<p>"My boy!" sharply whispered Father Brian.
"The king wheeleth his horse toward thee.
Stand thou still, for he hath his eye upon
thee."</p>

<p>In a moment more the hot blood was flushing
Ned's cheeks to redness, for the king drew
rein in front of him and spoke in Saxon. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Ned could have understood him he might have
been astonished, for he was saying:</p>

<p>"I saw thee row under the bridge, O boy
with a battered shield. Thou art the cunning
spearman that slew for me the Berserker and
opened the way for the advance. I thank
thee, whoever thou art. Thou art but young,
too, for such a doing. What is thy name?"</p>

<p>Ned more than half guessed that such a
question was asked him, and he promptly
responded in Latin:</p>

<p>"I am Ned, the son of Webb, O king!"</p>

<p>"Aha! Thou speakest Latin?" exclaimed
the king. "Thou seemest to be well born,
and thou art a scholar. What can I do for
thee? Speak quickly!"</p>

<p>"O Harold the King," said Ned. "I would
that I might ride with the army when it
marcheth away from York. William the Norman
is coming. I wish to be with thy house-carles
and fight the Normans for thee and for
England."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt that he had made a tremendously
long speech, and he had, but a bright smile
shot across the face of the king.</p>

<p>"That thou shalt have," he said, and he
added, to a horseman near him, "Wolfram of
Hythe, get good horses for this youth and for
his teacher that attendeth him. O priest,
remain thou with thy pupil. Go both of you
now to York. Ned, the son of Webb, I will
see thee again."</p>

<p>"I will be with him, O king," replied Father
Brian, loudly. "He is a youth of much
promise, and he needeth my continual instruction."</p>

<p>King Harold spurred away, followed by his
chiefs and thanes and earls, while the good
missionary turned almost indignantly upon
Ned.</p>

<p>"This is wrong!" he exclaimed. "Thou
art deceiving the king. I did not understand
at first, but I heard others of them repeat his
words. He believeth thee the slayer of Sikend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the Berserker from under the bridge. Thou
art not!"</p>

<p>"Was that it?" almost gasped Ned. "I
never said I was. I think it was a mean
thing to do, anyhow, to stab Sikend in the
legs, in that way, so he couldn't stand up and
fight. I'm sorry the king should think I would
do anything so unfair as that."</p>

<p>"So am I," said Father Brian, "for a lie is
a bad thing, any day. Thou must yet find
an opportunity to tell him the truth of that
matter. But I am glad, nevertheless, that
we are to have horses and get away from
York in good company. I have a great desire
to get speedily to London, whatever may happen
afterward."</p>

<p>Wolfram of Hythe did not have far to go
for his horses, and those which he was now
bringing forward were big enough for war-horses.
They had a somewhat jaded appearance,
for they had travelled far that day.
They had lost their riders in the battle, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
was explained, and in a moment more Ned
and the missionary were as well mounted as if
they both were house-carles of the king.</p>

<p>"It is well for us, indeed," said Father
Brian. "We shall have good quarters, and
rations, too, while we are on the march.
Thou wilt set the king right concerning
Sikend in due season, for truth's sake. Thou
didst not harm thy fellow soldier, and yet I
tell thee that the world cannot be civilised
until there are no more Berserkers. Small
matter it is how they are killed."</p>

<p>"I didn't even hurt the Saxon that did kill
him," said Ned. "He was drowned."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, almost," replied Father
Brian. "It will be better for thee to make
thine own explanation than for that house-carle
to come and tell the king thou art a
false witness."</p>

<p>"It's awful!" said Ned. "I'm a fraud!
It isn't any fault of mine, though, and I can
straighten it, as soon as I've a chance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The shadows of evening were deepening
when the two friends rode over Stamford
bridge and galloped on toward York. When
they reached the city it was almost dark, and
in all directions hundreds of men were going
about with torches and rude lanterns.</p>

<p>"The panes of glass in those lanterns,"
said Ned to himself, "are all made of cow's
horn, scraped thin. I guess they don't break
easily. They are better than nothing, though,
and we can find our way to the tavern."</p>

<p>So they did, and once more Ned had something
to say about lights.</p>

<p>"There's an awful difference," he remarked,
"between these rush-light smokers and electric
bulbs or gas, or even kerosene or candles.
Hollow rushes with fat poured into them!
They stand up pretty well in the sticks,
but they don't last long, and how they do
smoke!"</p>

<p>He did not allow his own rush-light to burn
down, however. As soon as the horses were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cared for and supper was eaten, he was glad
enough to get into bed.</p>

<p>"I do believe there is nothing else in all
the world," he said, "that will tire a fellow
out like a great battle. Father Brian was
right, though, about the trap that was set for
King Hardrada. Those two English earls,
Edwin and Morcar, knew well enough that
Harold was coming, and they had everything
ready when he got here. Hardrada ought to
have watched. He knew he was dealing with
his enemies. So did Tostig, and I believe he
suspected something."</p>

<p>Sleep stopped him there, and he arose the
next morning with a feeling that he was going
to walk out into something entirely new. He
was now no longer a Norway Viking, invading
England with Harold Hardrada the Sea
King. Nor was he any longer under the
special protection of Tostig the Earl. All of
his previous experiences, as he said of them,
were so many back numbers, and he was now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
King Harold of England's devoted follower.
He winced a little, also, when he remembered
that he was regarded as one of the heroes of
the great battle of Stamford bridge.</p>

<p>During this day and several more which
followed, he was left almost altogether by
himself, for Father Brian had affairs of his
own to attend to.</p>

<p>"It is just the way I'd like to have it," said
Ned. "Now I've a good horse that won't
pitch me over his head, as Nanny did, I'm
going to ride all around and see the country.
I'll see the city better, too. I'd like to tell
father and mother what I'm doing, too."</p>

<p>The city gates were open now, and all men
came and went at their will. There were
throngs of them, for all the country people
were eager to get a glimpse of their victorious
king and his wonderful army. Ned found
nothing to hinder him, therefore, and he made
his horseback excursions industriously. The
very first of them carried him once more over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Stamford bridge and across the battle-field.
He had thought he would wish to look at it
and remember the fighting, but he did not
linger there for a moment.</p>

<p>"It is too dreadful!" he exclaimed, urging
his horse forward. "I never want to see a
battle-field again, that is, not after all the
battle is over. I'll ride on and see if I can
visit Lars and Vebba."</p>

<p>It was not so very long a gallop to the
bank of the Humber. Large numbers of
Norway war-ships were still there, anchored
or moored to the shore, but Ned searched
among them in vain for a glimpse of his old
friend, the <i>Serpent</i>. The fact was that these
ships which remained were such as had been
surrendered after the defeat of Hardrada's
army. Quite a number, which had been ready
for sea, had sailed away at once, carrying such
Vikings as had not marched to the Derwent
at all, and with them a great many of the
first arriving fugitives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess she got away," said Ned. "She
belonged to Vebba. I hope he and Lars are
on board of her. Some day I mean to visit
Norway again and go and see them, but they'd
do better if they'd emigrate to America."</p>

<p>King Harold of England was dealing very
mercifully with the beaten invaders. It was
said that he had given two dozen of the captured
vessels for his prisoners to go home in.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do for him to kill them,"
remarked Ned, as he rode homeward. "I
guess he was glad to be rid of them."</p>

<p>Other days went by, and Ned spent most of
the in on horseback, so that he saw a great
deal of that part of Northumberland. He
returned to the tavern pretty well tired out,
one evening, and, just as he was carrying a
sputtering rush-light up-stairs, he heard heavy
footsteps behind him and a cheery voice that
shouted:</p>

<p>"My boy! Our luck hath come! A
messenger came from London to the king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
to-day, to tell him that the fleet of Duke
William of Normandy hath been seen off the
southern coast. Before Harold and his army
can get there, the Normans will all be landed.
They will have before them, soon, a greater
battle than the one that was fought with the
Norwegians, putting Fulford and Stamford
bridge together."</p>

<p>"That's bad news for England," said Ned.
"A host of men will be killed. I'm ready,
anyhow. I want to see King Harold win
another victory."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest very little about that,"
replied the missionary, going on up the stairs
with him. "No man may say how a battle
will turn out until after the fighting is over.
I will ask thee one thing, however. Canst
thou speak at all in French?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can," said Ned. "I learned it
at home, when I was a little chap."</p>

<p>"It may yet be a good thing for thee,"
said Father Brian. "I have it upon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
mind, however, that the greater part of
Duke William's motley army speak tongues
of their own, and not a word of French. It
is a speech I have not yet heard. It may be
that thou and I will listen to it before long."</p>

<p>"I guess so," said Ned. "I'll have a talk
with King Harold's French prisoners, after he
whips the duke."</p>

<p>Ned's admiration for the Saxon king had
been strengthening rapidly from day to day,
as he heard men talk about him. He did
not now entertain any idea that his hero
could really be beaten by Duke William.
At the same time, he had begun to pick up
rapidly a number of words of several kinds
of Saxon. This had helped him very much
in a number of conversations with the king's
house-carles. It had also proved convenient
at the tavern, among the citizens of York, and
among the country people.</p>

<p>The Saxon army had been resting well
during all these days, and it had been pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>paring
for the long, severe march which its
royal commander had known it must soon
perform. He, statesman as well as general,
had been setting in order the tangled affairs
of the great northern earldoms. The two
Earls of Mercia and Northumberland, Edwin
and Morcar, had professed utter loyalty to
him. They had promised to bring all the
forces they could muster to join the army
which was to oppose Duke William of
Normandy.</p>

<p>This, nevertheless, would require time,
and the king could not now wait for any
new levies. He was needed to defend the
southern counties of England, and, especially,
to prevent the speedy capture of London by
the Normans.</p>

<p>The mounted house-carles, the thingmen,
were ready to march on the day following
the arrival of the messenger who brought
the tidings concerning Duke William's fleet.
It may be that even then King Harold was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
aware of the terrible truth, that the landing
of the Normans had already begun at Pevensey,
on the southern coast, only three days
after the battle of Stamford bridge. He was
also aware, nevertheless, that the transfer
from ship to shore of such a host as that
of William, with its supplies, and with a
vast number of horses for its cavalry, was a
task which would surely require a number
of days. More time would necessarily be
consumed, after that, in getting the invading
army into shape for any considerable
forward movement. It was still possible,
therefore, for Harold and his army to get to
London in season. If he could save his capital
city, then would follow the awful struggle
that was sure to come for England's throne
and freedom.</p>

<p>Out of the Ouse gate of the old city of York
rode the mailed horsemen, in close array.
Behind them, in endless columns, strode the
footmen, thousand after thousand. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
not a man who saw them march away could
have believed what a fate was waiting for
them on the southern shore of the land they
were going to defend.</p>

<p>"My boy," said Father Brian, "thou and
I will keep close along toward the front.
The king himself rideth far ahead of all.
He intendeth to stir up, as he goeth along,
all the fighting strength of the middle
counties."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I won't have a chance to get
at him," replied Ned. "I want to let him
know the truth about that affair of Sikend
the Berserker."</p>

<p>"Thou mayest let that rest," said the good
missionary. "He hath quite enough to busy
him just now. I think he may be caring very
little who it was that speared one Viking.
Only I bid thee keep good care of thy tongue
and speak only the truth. It is always bad
for a man to win upon false pretences. See
that thou maintain thy honesty, my boy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess I will," said Ned. "There isn't
anything crooked about me. If a man will
tell a falsehood, the next thing he will be
caught passing counterfeit money."</p>

<p>"Thou hast a great many of thy York
Saxon sayings," remarked Father Brian,
"that thou art not able to turn into good
Latin. I have found it so with all the
heathen I have ever been among. It sometimes
maketh me wish that I were back at
Clontarf, to hear men talking good sense once
more. I give that up, however, for my duty
biddeth me to remain, that I may do somewhat
for the civilisation and instruction of
these ignorant English people."</p>

<p>This was an undertaking concerning which
the good man was becoming more and more
enthusiastic. It was plain that he cared for
it much more than he did for any victories
or defeats of either Norman William or Saxon
Harold.</p>

<p>Ned had heard him saying to himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Little odds is it which of the two shall
wear the crown, provided that these millions
of human beings shall be made over into
something better than so many two-legged
cattle. They are little more than that now."</p>

<p>At first, even after exploring York, Ned
had hardly agreed with him, but he learned a
great deal as they rode along and as he saw
the actual state of things in England.</p>

<p>Day followed day, and the mounted house-carles
rode steadily onward. Town after town,
camp after camp, was reached and left behind.
Everywhere the king was welcomed with noisy
acclamations. He appeared, indeed, to be
exceedingly well beloved by his subjects of
every rank and kind.</p>

<p>"They are all sorts, though," was a remark
that Ned was forced to make concerning
them, and he added: "What they want is
about forty thousand Father Brians."</p>

<p>Large numbers, he discovered, were no
better than slaves, the property of the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>holders.
They had no hope whatever of
improving their condition. Even the freemen
were only a shade better off. Not many, even
of the rich and titled, were able to read and
write. There were a great many other faults
to find.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," said Ned, "I almost think
England ought to be conquered. Harold or
somebody else ought to stir up things with a
long pole."</p>

<p>He was hardly able to say what he would
try to do first, if he were king, and he determined
to have a talk about it with Harold
some day after he should have beaten the
Normans.</p>

<p>The country they rode through was very
beautiful, after all. Some of the towns were
fairly well built. Some of the castles and palaces
were picturesque and attractive. There
were numberless green fields and fruitful
orchards. The flocks of sheep and the herds
of cattle looked like prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, too, there were grand old forests of
oaks and other trees, and Ned saw herd after
herd of beautiful red deer.</p>

<p>"No poor man dares to hunt them, they
tell me," he said of the deer. "They'd hang
him as if he'd killed a man. Not even if he
were starving. It is a good deal as Father
Brian says, the lower kinds of people in England
are treated as if they were beasts."</p>

<p>Above these, nevertheless, were the hundreds
of thousands of strong-armed yeomanry,&mdash;the
farmers, the squires, the thanes, great
and small, and from among these King Harold
was now trying to strengthen his army. No
doubt his success in doing so would have been
better if more time had been given him, but
as he pushed onward messenger after messenger
came riding swiftly to tell him of the
vast numbers and warlike appearance of the
host of William of Normandy. This was now
all landed, they reported, and it was almost
ready for a march upon London, where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
was nothing to oppose it but a moderate force
under Gyrth, Earl of the East Angles and
younger brother of the king.</p>

<p>"I want to see Gyrth," said Ned to the
missionary. "They say he is another hero
like Harold."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>




<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChXIIIc" name="ChXIII." id="ChXIII.">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE HOST OF THE NORMANS.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"L<span class="smcap">ondon</span>! London! London!" exclaimed
Ned, the son of Webb, slowly and
thoughtfully. "After all I had heard and
read about this place, I hadn't the ghost of an
idea of what it would really be. I went
through all the London guide-books, too, that
Uncle Jack brought home with him. I guess
it changed a good deal before they were
printed."</p>

<p>He had other remarks to make, and some
of them were uncomplimentary. It appeared
that he had been going through all quarters
of the English capital city, ever since
he rode into it with the house-carles of the
king. He knew something of its history, old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
British, Roman, Saxon, and he could add to
that wonderful ideas of what it would be in
the years to come. He had taken careful
notes of its larger buildings, its walls, and
fortifications.</p>

<p>"I think that Duke William was wise," he
remarked, "in not coming here until he was
entirely ready. It's a strong place. He could
not have taken it right away. King Harold
knew it could stand a siege or he would not
have gone to fight the Vikings."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, until the return of their king
and his army, the people of London had been
in a panic of fear lest their town should be
taken and sacked by the invaders.</p>

<p>"Now," said Ned, at last, "I have seen
enough of these dirty streets. They are as
bad as those of York, or worse. I'll go and
get my horse and see if Father Brian has
come."</p>

<p>His learned Irish friend had been full of
affairs of his own ever since their arrival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
He too, moreover, had been exploring London,
and he had formed a very low opinion
of its civilisation. Ned found him waiting,
shortly, in the queer old hostelry which had
been assigned them by the army authorities
as their quarters.</p>

<p>"My boy!" exclaimed Father Brian. "I
am glad to see thee. Oh, the heathen town
that this is! It is full of thieves. It is
exceedingly disorderly and dirty. I may say
that the army being here doth not make it
any better. Ah, me! I shall be glad when
the battle is over and we know which of the
twain is to be king of this place. Whichever
it may be, he hath a long, hard bit of work
before him to make this country what it
ought to be."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of that, but Ned,
the son of Webb, was not just now much
interested in questions of reform and education.
His head was full of army affairs, and
Father Brian was his best newspaper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed the missionary, in reply
to Ned's questioning. "Will the Saxons
fight? Indeed they will, and King Harold
himself is to lead his army. I am told that
his brother Gyrth&mdash;the brave man that he
is!&mdash;asked permission to lead this battle
himself, and urged the king to stay out of
it. He said that then Harold would have
time to gather more troops. Gyrth might
be defeated and killed, but the kingdom would
not be lost all at once. What is more, Harold
might lay waste all the lands nearest the
Normans and starve them out, fighting them
inch by inch. He is an unselfish patriot, to
offer his life in that way."</p>

<p>"What did the king say?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"As thou mightest expect, I think," replied
Father Brian. "He declared that he would
waste no English land nor burn an English
house. He would allow no other man to fight
and die in his place. He would lead his own
army, he said, and he is right about that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he isn't," said Ned. "He had better
take Gyrth's advice. He is risking too much
upon one battle. He hath not men enough
here to beat the Normans."</p>

<p>"King Harold knoweth best," said Father
Brian. "His men would not fight as well
under anybody else. His absence might dishearten
them. Now, I tell thee: they say
that the Norman duke hath sixty thousand
men, but that the most of them are of all
sorts, taken as they came. Harold of England
hath only a quarter as many, indeed,
but the main body of them consists of picked
and chosen warriors, well-disciplined veterans.
There is a great strength in that."</p>

<p>"Thou meanest," said Ned, "that no common
men are fit to face the house-carles? The
duke should have seen them at Stamford."</p>

<p>"He knoweth them, I suppose," said Father
Brian. "It maketh him slow and cautious.
The thingmen will all die where they stand,
and I think that many other men will die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
when they do. It is a pity that they were at
the north and not here when the fleet of William
came to Pevensey. Had they been at
hand, the Normans would not have gotten
ashore at all. Harold would have slaughtered
them at the water's edge."</p>

<p>"All of that is Tostig's work," said Ned,
angrily. "He stirred up Hardrada to come
with his Vikings, just at the worst time."</p>

<p>"He hath paid for it with his life," replied
Father Brian, "and it is a heavy load for any
man to put upon his soul. One bad, ambitious,
selfish plotter may sometimes do a vast
amount of bloody mischief."</p>

<p>All that was of the past, and there was no
help for it. Everybody was well aware, moreover,
that there had been an exchange of embassies,
day after day, between the king and
Duke William. Terms of settlement had
been offered and rejected, for neither of them
would give up the main point of dispute, the
right to the crown of England. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
there could be no compromise, and the sword
must decide.</p>

<p>While the two friends had been talking,
their horses had been brought out. They
mounted now, and rode out together through
one of the southerly gates.</p>

<p>"These walls and the forts are quite
strong," remarked Father Brian. "The
best work on them was done long ago by
the Romans. I have thought that if I were
Harold I would wait for the Normans at
this place."</p>

<p>"One of the house-carles told me," said Ned,
"that the king had chosen a better. He had
seen it himself. He hadn't the least idea that
the king will be beaten."</p>

<p>"He would not be," replied the missionary,
"if all of his men were like them. Man for
man, the Normans have nothing like them.
They will cleave through shield or mail or
helmet with a blow of their long-handled
axes. They fear nothing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>The guards posted at the city gates were
not questioning any who came or went, and
people from all directions were seeking safety
within the walls. None of these had yet been
harmed, but before Ned and his companion
had ridden many miles they found the
roads crowded with men, women, and children,
fleeing inland from the cruelty of the
invaders. Terrible tales were told by these
poor fugitives of the atrocities already inflicted
upon the shore-folk by the savage rabble of
which a large part of William's army consisted.
This was to have been expected,
whether the duke willed it or not, and
Saxon England was receiving a sad warning
of the methods by which, from that time
onward, its conquest was to be completed.</p>

<p>Both Ned, the son of Webb, and the missionary
were now getting excited, and they
rode faster. The whole affair was becoming
more real to them. It was a tremendous
thing to think of. The entire future history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of England was about to be decided by one
great fight, and everything relating to that was
to be studied with almost feverish interest.</p>

<p>It was late in the day when Father Brian
drew his rein, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"There, my boy, look yonder! That is
the ridge and hill of Senlac. That is where
Harold hath chosen to wait for William.
He is wise. It is a very strong military
position."</p>

<p>"Then why on earth," asked Ned, "did
not the duke send a force ahead and seize it?
It was right in his way, if he intended to
march for London."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he knew it not," said Father
Brian. "He is in a strange country. I
believe that he would prefer to have the
Saxon army come on and meet him, at
almost any place. What he needeth most
of all is this very battle to be fought without
delay, for his host is eating up its provisions.
This ridge of Senlac, if thou wilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
mark it, will prove a death-trap for him or
for Harold, as the fight may turn either way."</p>

<p>"Can the king be caught in it?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I know not, yet," grimly responded the
missionary. "I heard once, though, of a
man who trapped a bear. The trap was a
good one, and the bear was in it."</p>

<p>"How did it work, then?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"I heard that soon there was very little
left of either the trap or the hunter," growled
Father Brian. "It was a large bear. Come
on, now, and we will see what all these men
are doing. They are as busy as bees."</p>

<p>The long, low hill toward which they were
riding was somewhat steep upon its southerly
side. From end to end, it now swarmed with
toilers. It had been generally understood
that the Saxon army had not yet left London,
and who, then, were these?</p>

<p>Father Brian gazed at them in silence for a
minute or so before he turned in his saddle to
say, with energy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"The trap is well set for catching the
duke. King Harold knew what might be
done with this reach of land. He hath sent
on his two brothers and a sufficient force to
fortify the ridge. Seest thou? They are
making a strong breastwork of timber and
in some places more than that. I think it
might stop any charge of Duke William's
best horsemen. They will fare but badly,
with Harold's axmen behind the barrier. Let
us ride on."</p>

<p>There was an elevation high enough to be
described by Ned as a hill, at a little distance
behind the ridge, toward the right, and here,
too, the men were fortifying. The timber-work
defences at the front were sufficiently
extensive to bar the entire way by which the
Normans must come in their march northward
from their camps. These were not now at
their Pevensey landing-place, but near the
coast village of Hastings, several miles nearer
to Senlac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"That means Bloody Pond, or the Lake of
Blood," remarked Ned. "There is a pond in
New York State that is named so from an old
fight with the Indians. I don't see any kind
of pond around here."</p>

<p>"There may have been one, once," replied
Father Brian. "Maybe they let the water out
of it, or it dried up somehow and left the name
of it sticking to the hill. There will be blood
enough spilled here to fill a pond, I am afraid."</p>

<p>They rode nearer the hill, now, and on the
crest of it they saw two mailed men on
horseback.</p>

<p>"Hear them!" whispered Father Brian.
"Hark to the two great earls!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gyrth, my brother," said one of them,
loudly and cheerfully, "here will we set up
the standards. I think the axmen of England
can hold yonder lines against all the motley
pirates under Duke William."</p>

<p>"Or else," calmly responded Gyrth, "here
will the sons of Godwin die. Our brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Sveyn is gone, long since. Tostig is slain.
Harold and thou and I remain. Oh, Leofwine,
thou art ever light-hearted, but yonder is a
mighty host, between us and the sea."</p>

<p>"So be it," responded Leofwine, as recklessly
as ever. "Let them come on. I care
not at all to live under the yoke of William
the Norman. It were far better to die in
battle."</p>

<p>"I would that all England were of one mind
with thee in that matter," replied Gyrth.
"Then were we not so few, this day. The
levies of the midland counties are all so
laggard in coming. Moreover, Edwin and
Morcar have been but half-hearted, from the
beginning. I think they wait to hear the
ending of this very battle."</p>

<p>"They made a good fight at Fulford," said
Leofwine. "Many of the Northumberland
spearmen were at Stamford bridge. If we
may but baffle the first assault of the Normans
and hold them in check a few days, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
shall soon thereafter be strong enough to
send the Duke of Normandy back to his
ships."</p>

<p>"Such is the war policy of Harold," responded
Gyrth. "There is a deep wisdom in
it if we may hold our lines through but one
day only. I will say no more, now, my
brother. I have a strange foreboding upon
me, and I like not the name of this place."</p>

<p>"The Lake of Blood?" said Leofwine.
"Ay! All England will be made red enough
if we hold not the hill against Duke William.
Who knoweth the spot that waiteth for thine
and mine?"</p>

<p>"God only!" responded Gyrth. "I had
thought, too, that he would fight on our side
for the freedom of England."</p>

<p>They turned their horses' heads and rode
away from the hill to pass along the lines,
inspecting the defences. Both of the listeners
were silent a moment, for they had heard
enough to make them thoughtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those two are brave men," said Father
Brian, then. "I fear they have spoken a
hard truth. The people have not come to the
king's help loyally. They may pay for their
lack, sorely, after their king is gone from
them. Didst thou hear them speak of their
older brother, Sveyn? He was like them for
fighting well, but he had a wild spirit in him.
It is rare that there are five in one family that
are like the sons of old Earl Godwin."</p>

<p>Both of them wished for a closer look at
the defences, and they rode onward. It was
surprising how much had been done already,
and the force which the king had sent forward
to protect the workmen was more than half
of his army. Nothing less than a rush made
with all the power of the invaders could have
carried the ridge that evening.</p>

<p>"What I'd like to do, now," said Ned, "is
to ride out and try for a look at some of the
Norman camps. What sayest thou?"</p>

<p>"I am with thee," replied Father Brian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
"We may well ride sword in hand, my boy,
lest we chance to run against some stray party
of Normans. I will unsling my pole-ax. Where
didst thou get that long spear?"</p>

<p>"It was given me by one of the house-carles,"
said Ned. "It is not too heavy for
me, in spite of the long shaft. It is a kind of
lance."</p>

<p>"I will get me one like it, then, as soon as
I can," said the missionary, combatively. "I
may yet have to push some Norman from his
saddle. I can throw a spear fairly well, too.
That is one thing that I learned at Clontarf."</p>

<p>It was not a bad idea, certainly, that the
missionaries who were sent out in such times
as these were should be sufficiently well trained
in the use of weapons to defend themselves if
they should ever be attacked, for instance, by
bears or wolves.</p>

<p>At several places the Senlac ridge was cut
by ravines, which added to its defensive character.
At others, the Saxon workmen had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
dug deep ditches. At the weaker points,
where the slope below was less steep, strong
palisades had been set instead of mere breastworks.
In these lines of palisades were gateways,
and through one of these, which was as
yet left open, Ned rode out with Father Brian.</p>

<p>"It's a strong fort!" exclaimed Ned, as he
looked behind him at the defences.</p>

<p>"Ay," said Father Brian, "for such men as
will hold it. I think better of King Harold's
prospects. Unless I am in error, all the men
from the London camps were to march this
day. They will be here before sunrise to-morrow."</p>

<p>They were indeed arriving at that very
hour, but both the king and the duke were
willing that there should be no battle until
all things were ready on both sides. There
were to be further negotiations, and the fort
builders were to have more time for the completion
of their work.</p>

<p>There were several miles of broken country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
between Hastings and Senlac. Some of the
advanced encampments of the Normans were
very nearly midway between the Saxon lines
and the seashore.</p>

<p>It was toward one of these outermost camps,
containing, it might be, a large force of the
invaders, that Ned and the missionary were
now riding. So far as they could discern,
nothing in the nature of fortification had
been done here, for no attack was to be
expected. They were aware, nevertheless,
that Norman patrols would surely be out on
duty, and that loose parties from such an
army would probably be going hither and
thither, for plunder or even for mere
adventure.</p>

<p>"Hearest thou the sound of Duke William's
army?" said Ned. "It is like the early
morning roar of a great city."</p>

<p>"It is the sound of a cataract!" exclaimed
Father Brian. "I hear it, but I was thinking
of quite another thing, my boy. A swift dash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of the thingmen might make wild work of
yonder camp this night."</p>

<p>"King Harold could do a great deal better
than that," replied Ned. "If he had a few
batteries of heavy artillery on the ridge at
Senlac they would be within easy range of
all these camps. He could pitch percussion
shells among them all night long. Duke
William would find it very interesting, I can
tell him."</p>

<p>"Speak it in Latin," said the good man,
and then Ned found himself compelled to say
something which did not include shells and
long-range cannon.</p>

<p>"Hither cometh a Norman squad!" suddenly
interrupted the missionary, getting
ready his pole-ax. "Thy spear, my boy!
Be on guard! They are taking us for enemies
without question."</p>

<p>"I guess we will have to take them, then,"
said Ned. "There are only four of them.
Here goes!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>He spurred his horse forward as he spoke,
but it was not to meet genuine Norman men-at-arms.
These fellows were only Breton
marauders, armoured imperfectly and mounted
on ponies. They came dashing forward irregularly
instead of charging together.</p>

<p>"I hate to kill a man," muttered Ned, and
he did not do so, for the foremost Breton fell
from his pony with no worse harm than a
spear-wound in the arm.</p>

<p>Ned's shield caught a sword-cut from the
second assailant, and it was not repeated,
for Father Brian's ax came down upon that
man's helmet, and one more saddle was
empty.</p>

<p>"Down with them!" roared the valiant
missionary. "Thou hast laid one more upon
the sand!"</p>

<p>"The spear didn't go through his corselet
half an inch," said Ned, "but there he is."</p>

<p>The fourth Breton exchanged a few blows
with some skill, but Father Brian was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
much for him, and his pony, also, was quickly
riderless.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p class="center">"FOR FATHER BRIAN'S AX CAME DOWN UPON THAT
MAN'S HELMET."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"Father Brian hit him on his shoulder,
finely!" exclaimed Ned. "Come on, now!
We had better cut stick for Harold's camp."</p>

<p>"Thou art right about that," replied his
comrade; "there are more of them coming.
It did me much good to upset those heathen.
His reverence the Abbot of Clontarf knoweth
well what to do with a pole-ax. He drove off
twenty wild knaves, one day, when he was all
alone. We buried full half of them, that
evening, and the others knew better than to
come again. I tell thee, my boy, the peace
can be well kept in Ireland, especially anywhere
near the schools and civilisation."</p>

<p>It was well for them to ride rapidly now,
however, for they were pursued almost to a
gate of the Saxon army palisades. The one
they succeeded in reaching was closed and
guarded.</p>

<p>Even when Father Brian shouted out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
name and character and what he had been
doing, the officer in command of it let them
in only to conduct them at once into the
presence of Gyrth, Earl of the East Angles.</p>

<p>Near a blazing camp-fire, the light of
which glittered and sparkled upon his splendid
armour, stood the hero brother of King
Harold. Only the king, himself, could be
more loftily majestic in form and manner.
Not a word did he utter while Father Brian
made his very full report, and then he said:</p>

<p>"Our other scouts have erred somewhat,
it appeareth. The Normans have advanced
their camps nearer than we were aware, but
it is of no consequence. O priest, I know
thee and thy pupil to be true men. He slew
the Norway champion for us at Stamford
bridge, and thou wert with him. Go ye to
your camp!"</p>

<p>"Speak not a word!" whispered Father
Brian to Ned. "Thou mayest explain that
matter only to the king himself. Let well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
enough alone, this night. That is our safeguard
now, for we had broken orders and
knew it not. Ride on!"</p>

<p>Low, indeed, did Ned, the son of Webb,
bow to the Saxon hero, and he went on in
silence, but he was thinking, remorsefully:</p>

<p>"What would father and mother say? It
isn't honest! I am cheating them about
Sikend."</p>

<p>There seemed to be no help for it at present,
however, and he was glad to reach his camp
and dismount from his over-weary horse.</p>

<p>After supper, not even the roar which arose
from the army and the very busy fort-builders
could keep him awake, and he slept soundly
until morning.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="#ChXIVc" name="ChXIV." id="ChXIV.">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="ph3">THE BATTLE OF SENLAC.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">B<span class="smcap">oth</span> armies remained within their lines,
that Friday morning, and both were
busily preparing for battle. The commanders
as well as the warriors were making ready.</p>

<p>The instructions given by King Harold to
his men were to act altogether upon the defensive,
and to content themselves with their
strong position along Senlac ridge.</p>

<p>If his orders had been rigidly obeyed by all,
there would have been no victory won by
William of Normandy. The generalship of
the king and the valour of his warriors were
made of no avail by the headlong folly of the
less disciplined part of the Saxon army.</p>

<p>During this day, ambassadors went back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and forth, more than once, as if the last
possibility of peace had not already for ever
passed away. Harold could not consent to
any terms which did not include the immediate
departure of the invaders, and William
could not at this hour abandon his great
military enterprise without fighting a battle.</p>

<p>Both armies were in good spirits. The
Normans might well feel confidence in their
greatly superior numbers and in the established
reputation of Duke William as a successful
general. The Saxons, on the other
hand, appreciated the strength of their position,
and they were able to say to one another
that Harold, the son of Godwin, had never
lost a battle. They believed him to be at
least the equal of any living army leader.</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, and Father Brian
were busy all along the lines, from hour to
hour, but there was nothing warlike for them
to do. When, however, they returned to their
camp at evening, both of them appeared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
have become exceedingly English, or at least
Saxon, in feeling.</p>

<p>"I believe I know what's coming," said
Ned. "The Normans can't break in! We
can cut them all to pieces if they try it on."</p>

<p>"The fight will be long and hard," replied
the missionary, very seriously. "It will be
well for thee and me to obtain places of
observation upon as high ground as we may."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ned. "I want to see it
all. It will be something for me to tell about
when I get home. I shall never forget it as
long as I live!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy!" said the good man, "a
great many thousands of these Saxons and
Normans will not live to remember it."</p>

<p>They slept again, and arose with the sun of
Saturday, October 14, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1066, the day
of the great change which came to England.</p>

<p>It was yet early in the forenoon when Harold
the King rode slowly along his lines and
spoke good words to all his soldiers. Everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
they responded to him with loud, enthusiastic
acclamations of love and loyalty,
and fearlessness.</p>

<p>Duke William of Normandy also, attended
by a brilliant escort of celebrated warriors
and men of high rank, rode from one to
another of the serried masses of his mighty
host. He addressed them with fiery eloquence,
assuring them of complete and speedy
victory over the inferior forces opposed to
them.</p>

<p>They, as well as he, however, were able to
see how strong were the Senlac works, and
how warlike and firm was the Saxon array
behind the barriers.</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, and his companion
found that, from their post on the hill, they
had a good view of both armies. They had
been watching all movements and indications
with almost breathless interest. It was not
yet noon when Ned suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't this magnificent! I don't believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
there was ever anything more splendid
in all the world!"</p>

<p>"It will be a great battle, my boy," said
the missionary, "one of the greatest in all
history. There! Seest thou?"</p>

<p>"I see!" shouted Ned. "The Normans are
advancing! William's whole army is moving!
Oh, how I wish our men were armed
with breech-loaders! I wish we had Maxim
guns and cannon looking out through the palisades.
The Normans would never get near
enough to do any chopping on them, then."</p>

<p>"Chopping?" echoed the good man. "In
a very little, I think thou wilt see good chopping
done by the Saxons. The best of our
ax-men are at the front. Mark thou the
slingers behind them, and note King Harold's
bowmen. I would there were more
of them. The archers and slingers of Duke
William come on in advance of his horsemen."</p>

<p>"They are beginning, too," said Ned. "A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
stone from a sling will break a shield. They
say the Norman arrows will go through
armour."</p>

<p>"If they hit!" said the priest. "Mark,
now! This is the advantage of the king's
position."</p>

<p>Ned could understand it in a moment. The
duke's archers had a high reputation, but in
this beginning of the battle they laboured
under a serious disadvantage. All their skill
and strength were of small value, while they
were shooting from low ground at enemies
who were not only above them, but were protected
by walls of wood. It was evident that
until these defences were broken through
stones and arrows would make no important
impression upon Harold's men.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" exclaimed Father Brian. "They
sling well, but they are in need of more stones
to throw. A man may not carry a quarry in
a quiver. Small harm have they done, and the
sharp arrows are wasted on the palisades. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
think Duke William must do better than this,
or he will get no nearer London."</p>

<p>"How lead would tell just now!" responded
Ned. "The range is getting short enough
for heavy revolvers. Hurrah! Here come the
Norman spearmen and the mounted knights
in full armour. What can lances do against
palisades? This is grand!"</p>

<p>The duke's archers and slingers had suffered
heavy losses, and they now fell back
discomfited, leaving the Senlac slope littered
thickly with the victims of the shafts and
stones of the Saxons. All was clear, however,
for the desperate assault which was to test the
strength of King Harold's lines. If it were
successful, it would be proved that his judgment
as a general had been wrong, and that
he ought not to have faced the invaders at
Senlac.</p>

<p>The attack was made in excellent order,
and with desperate courage, by masses which
seemed to be overwhelming. As they pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
onward up the slope, the arrows and javelins
of the Saxons came among them in a death-dealing
storm, slaying or disabling both
horses and men by the hundred. They did
not waver, however, and now their foremost
ranks had reached the palisades to be met by
the long spears, the missiles, and the terrible
pole-axes.</p>

<p>"How they go down, the Normans!"
gasped Ned. "They have not broken
through at any place. They are falling
back! They are beaten! What will the
duke do, now?"</p>

<p>Up to this moment, the King of England
and his two brothers had remained on the
hill, together, that they might better observe
the operations of both armies, and it must
have seemed to them that their plan of battle
promised complete success. On the duke's
left, indeed, his host of Bretons, horse and foot,
had suffered such severe losses that they were
retreating in much disorder. In their panic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
rout they were confusing also his left centre,
and at the same time his entire right wing
had staggered back down the slope in dismay.</p>

<p>Terrible was the disappointment and wild
was the wrath of the Norman leader as he
witnessed this first result of the stubborn
valour of the Saxons. They had suffered
small loss, comparatively, and their confidence
in themselves and in their king was
stronger than ever. It was only too strong,
for it became a great danger.</p>

<p>Sometimes the power of a really great
leader of men shows at its best under adverse
circumstances. Dark as seemed the prospect
before him, Duke William had lost neither
heart nor hope. He was among his troops,
now, galloping from point to point, commanding,
directing, encouraging, even threatening.
It was by his own personal exertions and
address that his beaten forces were rallying
at the very moment when the Saxon right
wing, contrary to the strict orders of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Harold, broke forth from the security of its
defences to pursue the fleeing Bretons.</p>

<p>Ned, the son of Webb, heard, or thought he
heard, a terrible exclamation from the king,
and then both of the earls, his brothers, Gyrth
and Leofwine, spurred away. They went to
recall the mistaken sally of their overconfident
men, but they were too late.</p>

<p>The quick eyes of Duke William had instantly
perceived his opportunity. He was
already reinforcing with fresh troops his
rallying fugitives, and at once, in the open
field, their superior numbers became available.
In vain did their rash Saxon pursuers rally
around the two royal brothers. In vain did
they cut down hundreds of their foemen while
they strove to fight their way back to the
shelter of their Senlac defences.</p>

<p>"Swarms!" groaned Ned. "Oh, what
swarms of Normans are pouring around those
men! William himself is there! More of his
men-at-arms are charging in! His very best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
knights! What? There! He and Earl
Gyrth are fighting, hand to hand! William's
horse is killed! He has fallen! He is up
again! Gyrth's horse, too, is killed! They
are fighting again on foot! Is it Gyrth? No,
I can see William! Yes! Oh, dear! Gyrth is
dead!"</p>

<p>It was terribly exciting to watch such a
struggle as this had become. Near him sat
King Harold, himself, upon his horse, as
motionless as a bronze image.</p>

<p>"Father Brian," whispered Ned, hoarsely,
"Leofwine, too, is down. King Harold hath
no brothers, now. He must fight the rest of
this battle alone. Oh, this is dreadful!"</p>

<p>Dark, indeed, had now become the prospect
before the central body of the Saxon army.
Although the defences in front of it were
unbroken, those at its right as well as at its
left were very soon passed by the Normans.
It was afterward said that Duke William had
cunningly ordered his troops on the Saxon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
right also to pretend flight, that their enemies
might be tempted to follow as those on the
left had followed the Bretons.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a href="#nearc" id="near">
<img class="border" src="images/image12.jpg" width="375" height="518" alt="&quot;NEAR HIM SAT KING HAROLD HIMSELF, UPON HIS
HORSE, AS MOTIONLESS AS A BRONZE IMAGE.&quot;" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">"NEAR HIM SAT KING HAROLD HIMSELF, UPON HIS
HORSE, AS MOTIONLESS AS A BRONZE IMAGE."</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>However that may be, the sun was now
sinking, and the centre of King Harold's army
was all that was left of it in good fighting
order. Of its assailants, the number which
had fallen was believed to equal, man for man,
that of all the Saxons who had been present
at Senlac that morning. Nearly a fourth
part of Duke William's army, therefore, lay
upon the field. The remainder of it, however,
still outnumbered, five to one, the remnant
of King's Harold's heroes.</p>

<p>Firm as a rock stood these, and against them
the furious tide of the invaders, horsemen
and footmen, broke in vain. Still they held
their strong position upon the hill of the
standards, the Golden Dragon of England and
the Fighting Man that was Harold's own personal
banner. The king, himself, was now
fighting on foot in the front rank of his house-carles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and he had performed mighty deeds
of valour.</p>

<p>In this hour, however, the subtle war cunning
of the duke came to his aid. The shields
and the armour of the closely serried Saxons
behind these remaining works prevented the
shafts of his bowmen from injuring greatly
the solid wedge of warriors into which the
thingmen and their comrades had formed
themselves around and on the hill. The
battle could not be altogether lost so long as
this living wall should remain unbroken. All
the Saxons were on foot, and the Normans,
who were mounted, gained little thereby,
since their unarmoured horses were so often
killed by javelins as they pressed forward.</p>

<p>"Shoot up! Shoot up!" shouted the duke
to his archers. "Let the shafts fall upon
them from above. They have no shields over
their heads."</p>

<p>Thousands of strong-armed bowmen at once
obeyed him. In a moment more, it was as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
a thick hail of sharp arrows was falling
among the Saxons behind, while those who
were in front were still compelled to hold
their shields before them. The cunning device
of the duke might yet have been baffled, perhaps,
but for one of its first fatal consequences.
Man after man was going down, and the king
himself looked up to see what this might be.
Even as he raised his head, the battle was lost,
and the crown of England passed to William
of Normandy, for from the sky above, as it
seemed, a hissing shaft came down and pierced
through his right eye to the brain.</p>

<p>"The king hath fallen!" screamed Ned,
the son of Webb. "Harold is dead! He is
dead! We are beaten! England is conquered!"</p>

<p>"Come thou on with me, then," said
Father Brian. "There are plenty of horses.
We must speed away from this place. The
house-carles are wearied with long fighting,
but they will all die where they stand. Thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and I have no need to die with them.
Quickly, now, my boy!"</p>

<p>Fierce, frenzied, desperate, was the last
stand of the Saxons around the royal standards
and the dying king. Terrible was the
carnage which they made among the Normans,
but it was as Father Brian had said:
the warriors of Harold were worn out with
long fighting, and they were now continually
assailed by arrivals of fresh troops, men who
had hitherto done little or nothing. Flesh
and blood could endure no more, and the
work of destruction was slowly completed.
One strong body of Saxons, it was afterward
related, was actually getting away when the
darkness came. It was closely followed by
the duke himself and his men-at-arms. Then
the Saxons turned again upon their pursuers,
and William not only lost many horsemen,
but came very near losing his own life also in
the hour of victory.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go now?" asked Ned, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
he and his friend clambered into the saddles
of two horses which had been tethered in the
rear of the lost position on the hill.</p>

<p>"I will guide thee, my boy," replied the
missionary. "Thou and I may make good
our escape, if we are prudent."</p>

<p>"How on earth can we get away from the
Normans?" groaned Ned. "Some of them
are between us, already, and all the rest of
England. I don't see how we are to get
through William's army."</p>

<p>"We must get out of the battle, first,"
said Father Brian. "Then we'll ride away
around into the Norman camps at the seashore.
We would do well to obtain speech
with him in the morning. Now that he hath
slain King Harold and considereth himself
the ruler of England, he will gladly welcome
any from among the Saxons who cometh to
him with a peaceful tongue. Be thou mindful
of that, my boy. I am glad that thou art
able to speak French to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"So am I," said Ned, with some energy.
"I'd really like to have a good talk with
William the Conqueror. But, oh, Father
Brian! this hath been an awful affair.
They will not need so many surgeons or
ambulances or hospitals as civilised armies
would. As soon as any man is down, somebody
killeth him. They do not seem to know
what mercy is."</p>

<p>"That they do not," said Father Brian.
"Thou wilt bear in mind, however, that
the killing of King Harold and all of his
best men giveth to William of Normandy
all the good title he hath to the crown
of England. If Harold had escaped all
alone from this battle-field he would be
king still."</p>

<p>"The English elected him fairly," replied
Ned. "Not one voter among them put in a
ballot for the duke. I suppose they won't try
to do any more against him after this, though.
Let him have it, then. All I can say is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
I hope there will never be another invasion
of England by anybody."</p>

<p>"No man may foretell concerning that
matter," said the missionary. "There hath
been much fighting on this island. Even
Ireland herself hath been attacked many a
time, and she might be again. It is my
opinion, though, my boy, that England will
for ever continue to be English, whoever is
king, even as Ireland continueth Irish."</p>

<p>"Most likely thou art right," replied Ned.
"The duke may bring in droves on droves of
Normans and all sorts. He won't think of
killing off the Angles, and Saxons, and Danes,
and Welsh, and Scotch. We don't, when
they come to America. Every kind that
lands among us becometh American, and I
shouldn't wonder if even the Normans became
Englishmen."</p>

<p>"Better for them to become civilised," said
the missionary, thoughtfully. "The duke
will kill none unless it may be a few earls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and other high men who may stand in his
way, or such commoners as resist him. I
think he will speak all others fairly and make
peace with them. Were he not to do so,
there are axes enough left in England to
make away with all that the Senlac battle
hath left of his army."</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed Ned. "I've seen
some of them. Anyhow, I don't want to be
an English earl just now. It wouldn't be
safe."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Father Brian. "Faster!
The farther we get away from Senlac the
safer we will be from sword and spear. It is
getting very dark. I am glad of it."</p>

<p>After that he did not again draw his rein
until they had almost reached a line of tents
a little distance inland from the town of
Hastings.</p>

<p>"Now do I wish I knew," he declared,
emphatically, "which of these may happen
to belong to some man who was killed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
battle. Oh, Ned, the son of Webb, let us
make trial of this large one that is nearest at
hand. Speak thou to yonder gaily apparelled
youth in thy best French."</p>

<p>"Ho! whose tent is this?" Ned asked at
once, as he rode nearer.</p>

<p>He shouted his question at a young man
who appeared to be a sort of esquire, stepping
hastily forward from the canvas doorway to
meet them.</p>

<p>"This is the marquee of the Sieur Raoul
de Berri," replied its custodian. "Whether
he be now alive or dead we know not. What
news, if any, have ye from the battle?"</p>

<p>"Of thy master I know nothing," said Ned,
"but of the battle I can tell thee that the
Saxon army is beaten and that Harold the
King is dead. Hard hath been the fighting,
all day, and the slain are many."</p>

<p>There had been hurrying feet from all
directions toward the spot where the two
newcomers had halted, and so there had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
been other hearers besides the gay esquire of
Sieur Raoul de Berri. Loud and prolonged
were the shouts with which the announcement
made by Ned was received, for before
this there had arrived doubtful news from the
hard contested field.</p>

<p>"Dismount ye and come in," said the esquire.
"Well may we feast the bringers of
joyful tidings. Whoever ye may be, ye are
most welcome. Even while ye are eating and
drinking, moreover, we pray you to talk on.
We would gladly hear all that we may concerning
the great battle. How was it fought?
Can ye tell us the names of any that were
slain? How fareth it with our liege lord
the duke, that shall henceforth be King of
England?"</p>

<p>It was truly a good thing that Ned, the
son of Webb, was so well practised in his
French, albeit the kind he spoke varied much
from that which was now being uttered so
volubly around him. For once, indeed, Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Brian was left to something which to him
painfully resembled silence.</p>

<p>Before long, however, there arrived a swarm
of French and Norman clergymen, all of whom
could understand the kind of Latin taught in
the great school at Clontarf. Speedily, then,
the good missionary went out with them, and
Ned was left alone to entertain his tent-full
of eager and excited listeners. All the
while, moreover, the good news spread rapidly
through all that camp and was carried on to
others.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Ned to the esquire, at last, "I
am tired out! I think there is nothing else
that will use up a man so completely as a
great battle."</p>

<p>"Ay!" exclaimed his new friend, hospitably.
"Thy couch is prepared for thee.
Thou hast fought well this day. Well am
I assured that our liege lord, the Duke of the
Normans, and the Sieur de Berri himself
would have us take all care of thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall be glad to get to bed," said Ned.</p>

<p>"Sleep thou well," replied the esquire,
"and on the morrow thou shalt surely be
brought into the presence of the duke, as
thou desirest."</p>

<p>The appointments of that marquee and the
comfort of its arrangements for sleeping were
more in accordance with Norman luxury than
with Saxon plainness. Ned, the son of Webb,
took note of them, weary as he was. Nevertheless,
before his eyes closed he was thinking:</p>

<p>"If here isn't another of these frauds! I
didn't do any real fighting, for either side.
I'm afraid it's as bad, almost, as the Stamford
bridge humbug, and what to do about it I
don't know. Oh, how sorry I am that I had
no opportunity for telling King Harold that I
did not kill Sikend the Berserker. I shall
always have the credit of it, without any
fault of mine. They may put it into books
of history, just like other great exploits."</p>

<p>His slumbers were long and heavy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
they were broken at last by a friendly shaking
at the hands of Father Brian.</p>

<p>"Up! Up!" he shouted. "O Ned, the son
of Webb, hasten and eat thy breakfast. The
Duke of Normandy cometh. Not yet, I think,
are we to call him the King of England.
That may not be until he hath been duly
crowned as king. My boy, I trust that now
thou art shortly to have speech with him."</p>

<p>Ned became very wide awake while he
heard what the missionary had to say, and
his mind grew very busy.</p>

<p>"I thought likely," he said, "that the
duke would come back to his camp. He
won't march for London till he knoweth what
the other Saxons are doing. His army was
badly mauled, yesterday, anyhow, and he
must get it into shape again."</p>

<p>The army of Norman invaders had indeed
been seriously damaged. If a second English
army could have attacked them on the day
after Senlac, it would have found them unfit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
for another such struggle. There was no
such army in existence, however, and William
went on with his plans without armed interruption.
He went first to inspect his fleet,
and he sent the greater part of it back to
Normandy and other places.</p>

<p>At about the middle of the forenoon of that
day, the duke was at a camp a little south
of Hastings, attended by a number of his
great men. Among them were his brother
Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and Lanfranc, the
famous scholar.</p>

<p>Here it was that Ned, the son of Webb,
and Father Brian were brought before him,
and they had already been named to the stern
and haughty Conquerors as the persons who
had brought the first tidings of the victory.</p>

<p>"They are guests of mine, my liege," said
the Sieur Raoul de Berri, as he saw them
approaching. "The youth is a young thane
from Northumberland, and the priest is his
tutor. They have prayed for an audience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"This day will I hear but few words from
any," replied the duke, "but if it will please
thee, the boy may speak. Let the priest keep
silence. What wilt thou, O Ned, the son of
Webb?"</p>

<p>Ned had recently become somewhat hardened
to meetings with remarkable men, but
he was now gazing at the Conqueror with
manifest admiration. Harold, the son of Godwin,
himself, had not appeared more royally
majestic or carried in his face such an expression
of conscious power, combined with indomitable
strength of will. Ned kept his
courage up, however, and boldly responded:</p>

<p>"O Duke of Normandy and Conqueror of
England, all I wanted to say to thee is this:
The best thing thou canst do for this country,
now it is thine, is to run in railroads and
telegraph lines and newspapers as fast as
thou art able. Also, thou hadst better have
Mr. Lanfranc appointed Superintendent of
Public Schools. He can set up primary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
grammar schools and academies and universities,
all over the island. I can tell him
what books to get and where to get them.
I will give him, now, a complete list of all I
went through at Grammar School Number
Sixty-eight. He couldn't beat it if he should
try&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Halt thou then!" interrupted the duke.
"Lanfranc, this youth's matter appertaineth
to thee. I know naught of such affairs. Let
his tutor lead him away now. He is but
malapert to urge me at such a time as this.
Forward, all! Odo, my brother, we have
much to do ere sunset. England is yet but
half won and we sheathe not our swords yet."</p>

<p>Father Brian's hand had been upon the
bridle of Ned's horse, and he hurried him
away.</p>

<p>"O Ned, the son of Webb!" he exclaimed,
"what is in thee? Thou art overdaring.
The duke was all but wroth with thee!"</p>

<p>"I guess that is so," said Ned. "His eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
flashed as if he had half a mind to hit me, and
I don't see why. I gave him the best kind
of advice. Didst thou not say that thou hast
some of thy clergymen friends to consult
with?"</p>

<p>"That have I," replied Father Brian, "and
I must go quickly to meet them. Thou
mayest amuse thyself by riding around for
awhile. Then get thee back to the tent of
the good Sieur de Berri. There or elsewhere
I hope to meet thee again, for our companionship
hath been exceedingly pleasant and
profitable. Fare thee well, for the hour. I
must go."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, then, Father Brian," said Ned.
"Come back to the tent, if thou canst. I
hope thou wilt soon have a mission school of
thine own. There will be scholars enough,
but where thou wilt get books and things, I
can't guess."</p>

<p>Away rode the good missionary, and Ned,
the son of Webb, was left to himself. He did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
not feel like exploring the camps of the Normans,
and his horse galloped on with him
until he was pulled in at the shore of the sea.
It was at a place where a narrow wooden pier
jutted out from a sandy beach between high
rocks on either hand.</p>

<p>Here Ned dismounted and walked down to
the water's edge, like a boy in a dream. A
small scow-built punt, with a mast and sail in
it, lay rocking on the waves by the pier.</p>

<p>"I will take off my armour before I get in,"
he remarked. "I'm glad I kept on my outing
shirt and my trousers under my mail, all the
while. This is a very curious business. I
saved my hat, too. Oh, don't I feel easier
and lighter? I never want to be an ironclad
again."</p>

<p>His helmet and mail and shield and weapons
were pitched from him across the sand in a
hurry, and he stepped eagerly into the boat.
A good wind was blowing offshore and he
put up the sail to catch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't feel like rowing," he remarked,
"after such a time as I have had. This
breeze ought to take me to the other side
before sunset. It is a good thing for me that
this is Green Lake and not the Atlantic Ocean
or the North Sea. Oh, what a tremendous
book that is. It's safe in the cubby under the
stern seat, too."</p>

<p>On he sailed, after that, swiftly and silently,
over the sparkling billows of the little lake.
Almost before he was aware of it, the punt ran
ashore at the place where Nanny had so skilfully
pitched him over her head. He saw the
two-wheeled barrow among the weeds a few
yards away and he went and brought it to the
margin. Into it he carried, with great care
and an appearance of something like respect,
the great folio History of the Normans.</p>

<p>"I'll go home now," he thought, "but I
wish I had Lars with me, and Father Brian.
I'd like to show father and mother and all of
them my armour."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>He found it tiresome work to trundle the
barrow, and he was both warm and weary
when he reached his grandfather's gate.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he exclaimed. "There's
a whole crowd of them, waiting for me."</p>

<p>"Hullo, Ned!" came loudly from within
the gate. "Where have you been all day?"</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle Jack&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear child!" interrupted Grandmother
Webb. "I was almost beginning to be
worried about you. Why did you stay so?"</p>

<p>"Did you catch anything?" asked his
grandfather. "Did you get any bites?"</p>

<p>"Well!" responded Ned, hardly knowing
exactly what to say. "I'll tell you how it is.
It was this book."</p>

<p>"My folio!" exclaimed Grandfather Webb.
"I had no idea that you really would take it
along. I'd have said no!"</p>

<p>"I did," said Ned. "I've been invading
England with Harold Hardrada of Norway
and the Vikings. Then I went all the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
from York and the battle of Stamford bridge
to the battle of Senlac, with King Harold of
England and Duke William the Conqueror."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" exclaimed Uncle
Jack. "I know how that is, myself. A
man can sit in his own room, nowadays, and
travel all around the world. All he needs is
plenty of guide-books and maps and histories.
You've been doing it, have you? I think you
had better keep it up and learn something.
Travel everywhere. See all there is to be
seen, and know all you can."</p>

<p>"That's what I think I'll do," replied Ned,
"but it's hard work, if there's as much fighting
as I've been having."</p>

<p>He had the folio in his arms now, as if he
were hugging it, but his grandfather took it
away as if he were pleased to get it back
unwetted by a bath in Green Lake, and carried
it back to its place in the library.</p>
